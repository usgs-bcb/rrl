elucidate broad-scale environmental controls of coniferous forest reproduction in the Sierra Nevada, California, we monitored reproduction for 5 years in 47 plots arrayed across a steep elevational (climatic) gradient. We found that both absolute seedling densities (stems &lt; 1.37 m) and seedling densities relative to overstory parent tree basal area declined sharply with elevation. Rates of seedling turnover (the average of birth and death rates) also declined with elevation. In contrast, seed production was not predicted by elevation and was highly variable from year to year. During a mast year of seed production, the intensity of masting was uneven among plots. Seedling densities were elevated only during the single year immediately following the mast year, suggesting reproduction in our forests may be primarily limited by abiotic factors such as the availability of suitable sites and weather. Disturbance also clearly affected reproduction; plots that had recently burned had significantly higher seedling to parent tree ratios for Abies species, suggesting that even though established Abies concolor may be relatively susceptible to fire, the species can recover rapidly through prolific reproduction. Since reproductive failures may be our earliest signal of changing forest conditions, seedling dynamics could provide a sensitive, if variable, indicator of environmental changes. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of prescribed fires used to reduce fuel loads and restore fire have been monitored in Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon National Parks for over 30 years. Ten years following prescribed fire treatments in Sequoia and Kings Canyon, mean total fuel loads accumulated to 84 percent of pre-fire levels in ponderosa pine forests, 83 percent in white fir-mixed conifer, and 66 percent in giant sequoia-mixed conifer forests. Thirty-one years after burning, mean fuel load of fine and sound woody fuels increased in ponderosa pine research plots in Yosemite. Most fuel accumulation appeared to occur within the first decade after fire, however the post-fire fuel complex was different than that pre-fire. In areas that have remained unburned, surface fuel accumulation appears to be relatively slow and may indicate that decay rates have approached accumulation rates for the mixed-conifer forest types. This long-term information has important implications for fire  anagement planning, including scheduling fuel hazard reduction and subsequent maintenance treatments.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/1008360</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brooks, M.

The most dramatic changes have occurred in middle elevation shrublands dominated by creosotebush (Larrea tridentata), Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia), and/or blackbrush (Coleogyne ramossissima), where most of the fires occurred between 1980 and 2004. This zone is more susceptible than other areas of the Mojave Desert to increased fire size following years of high rainfall. Increases in fire size are likely related to the flush of non-native annual grasses, Bromus rubens in particular, that produces continuous fuelbeds following years of high rainfall. This dynamic also has occurred to some degree at lower elevations, but the background cover of native perennial fuels there is already very low, muting the effects of the ephemeral fuels. At elevations above the middle elevation shrublands, fire size does not vary with rainfall, indicating that native woody fuels dictate fire regimes. These results suggest that an invasive plant/fire regime cycle is currently establishing in the middle and possibly the low elevation shrublands of the Mojave Desert, but not at higher elevations.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70028899</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pederson, Gregory T.</author><author>Gray, Stephen T.</author><author>Fagre, Daniel B.</author><author>Graumlich, Lisa J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Long-duration drought variability and impacts on ecosystem services: A case study from Glacier National Park, Montana</title><secondary-title>Earth Interactions</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Earth Interactions</full-title></periodical><pages>1-28</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Ecosystem services</keyword><keyword>Glacier National Park</keyword><keyword>Paleoclimatology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1087-3562</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/EI153.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Abstract Instrumental climate records suggest that summer precipitation and winter snowpack in Glacier National Park (Glacier NP), Montana, vary significantly over decadal to multidecadal time scales. Because instrumental records for the region are limited to the twentieth century, knowledge of the range of variability associated with these moisture anomalies and their impacts on ecosystems and physical processes are limited. The authors developed a reconstruction of summer (June–August) moisture variability spanning a.d. 1540–2000 from a multispecies network of tree-ring chronologies in Glacier NP. Decadal-scale drought and pluvial regimes were defined as any event lasting 10 yr or greater, and the significance of each potential regime was assessed using intervention analysis. Intervention analysis prevents single intervening years of average or opposing moisture conditions from ending what was otherwise a sustained moisture regime. The reconstruction shows numerous decadal-scale shifts between persisten...</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70160237</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><titles><title>Mapping new terrain climate change and America’s West: Anticipating challenges to western mountain ecosystems and resources</title></titles><pages>32-32</pages><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>PSW-MISC-77</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70160267</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Manies, K L</author><author>Harden, J W</author><author>Veldhuis, Hugo</author><author>Trumbore, Sue</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Soil Data from a Moderately Well and Somewhat Poorly Drained Fire Chronosequence near Thompson, Manitoba, Canada</title></titles><pages>30-30</pages><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2006-1291</isbn><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20061291</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keeley, J E</author><author>Fotheringham, C J</author><author>Baer-Keeley, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Demographic patterns of postfire regeneration in Mediterranean-climate shrublands of California</title><secondary-title>Ecological Monographs</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Monographs</full-title></periodical><pages>235-255</pages><volume>76</volume><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70030473</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Turetsky, Merritt R.</author><author>Harden, Jennifer W.</author><author>Friedli, Hans R.</author><author>Flannigan, Mike</author><author>Payne, Nicholas</author><author>Crock, James</author><author>Radke, Lawrence</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Wildfires threaten mercury stocks in northern soils</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>33</volume><issue>16</issue><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0094-8276</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2005GL025595</electronic-resource-num><abstract>With climate change rapidly affecting northern forests and wetlands, mercury reserves once protected in cold, wet soils are being exposed to burning, likely triggering large releases of mercury to the atmosphere. We quantify organic soil mercury stocks and burn areas across western, boreal Canada for use in fire emission models that explore controls of burn area, consumption severity, and fuel loading on atmospheric mercury emissions. Though renowned as hotspots for the accumulation of mercury and its transformation to the toxic methylmercury, boreal wetlands might soon transition to hotspots for atmospheric mercury emissions. Estimates of circumboreal mercury emissions from this study are 15-fold greater than estimates that do not account for mercury stored in peat soils. Ongoing and projected increases in boreal wildfire activity due to climate change will increase atmospheric mercury emissions, contributing to the anthropogenic alteration of the global mercury cycle and exacerbating mercury toxicities for northern food chains.).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70029012</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Middleton, Beth A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fire management in fens and wet grasslands grazed by cattle</title></titles><pages>5-5</pages><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2006-1268</isbn><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20061268</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jehle, G</author><author>Savidge, J A</author><author>Kotliar, N B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Green-tailed Towhee response to prescribed fire in montane shrubland</title><secondary-title>Condor</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Condor</full-title></periodical><pages>634-646</pages><volume>108</volume><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70028209</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Merriam, K.

The effects of repeated fires on snag densities in ponderosa pine forests of the southwestern USA have not been studied. Line intercept sampling was used to estimate snag densities in areas of the Gila Wilderness that had burned one to three times under Wildland Fire Use for Resource Benefit (WFU), a fire management policy implemented since 1974 aimed at restoring natural fire regimes. Twenty randomly located transects were measured in areas burned since 1946; six in once-burned areas, six in twice-burned areas and eight in thrice-burned areas. The mean density ± standard errors of large (&gt;47.5 cm dbh) snags for areas that burned once, twice and thrice was 7.0 ± 2.7, 4.4 ± 1.1 and 4.1 ± 1.3 snags/ha, respectively. Differences in snag densities between once- and multiple-burned areas were significant (F-test; p &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference in density of large snags between twice- and thrice-burned areas. Proportions of type 1 snags (recently created) were higher in once- and twice-burned areas than in areas that burned three times, likely reflecting high tree mortality and snag recruitment resulting from an initial entry fire. Type 3 snags (charred by previous fire) were more abundant in areas that burned multiple times. The lack of differences in snag densities between areas that burned two and three times suggests that repeated fires leave many snags standing. The increasing proportion of type 3 snags with repeated fires supports this conclusion. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

A total of 46 non-native species (all herbaceous) were recorded in the two data sets. They occurred in all seven of the major plant formations in the park, but were least common in subalpine and upper montane conifer forests. There was no significant difference in species richness or cover of non-natives between burnt and unburnt areas for either data set, and environmental gradients had a stronger effect on patterns of non-native species distribution, abundance and species composition than burning. Cover and species richness of non-natives had significant positive correlations with slope (steepness) and herbaceous cover, while species richness had significant negative correlations with elevation, the number of years post-burn, and cover of woody vegetation. Non-native species comprised a relatively minor component of the vegetation in both burnt and unburnt areas in Yosemite (percentage species = 4%, mean cover &lt; 6.0%), and those species that did occur in burnt areas tended not to persist over time. The results indicate that in many western montane ecosystems, fire alone will not necessarily result in increased rates of invasion into burnt areas. However, it would be premature to conclude that non-native species could not affect post-fire succession patterns in these systems. Short fire-return intervals and high fire severity coupled with increased propagule pressure from areas used heavily by humans could still lead to high rates of invasion, establishment and spread even in highly protected areas such as Yosemite.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70030540</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Westerling, A.

Much of the public and scientific discussion of changes in western United States wildfire has focused instead on the effects of 19th- and 20th-century land-use history. We compiled a comprehensive database of large wildfires in western United States forests since 1970 and compared it with hydroclimatic and land-surface data. Here, we show that large wildfire activity increased suddenly and markedly in the mid-1980s, with higher large-wildfire frequency, longer wildfire durations, and longer wildfire seasons. The greatest increases occurred in mid-elevation, Northern Rockies forests, where land-use histories have relatively little effect on fire risks and are strongly associated with increased spring and summer temperatures and an earlier spring snowmelt.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70028174</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Harden, Jennifer W.</author><author>Manies, Kristen L.</author><author>Turetsky, Merritt R.</author><author>Neff, Jason C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of wildfire and permafrost on soil organic matter and soil climate in interior Alaska</title><secondary-title>Global Change Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Change Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>2391-2403</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire</keyword><keyword>Black spruce</keyword><keyword>Boreal</keyword><keyword>Carbon</keyword><keyword>Combustion</keyword><keyword>Fire emission</keyword><keyword>Fractal analysis</keyword><keyword>Ground fuel</keyword><keyword>Moss cover</keyword><keyword>OIrganic mat</keyword><keyword>Organic soil</keyword><keyword>Peat</keyword><keyword>permafrost</keyword><keyword>Soil</keyword><keyword>Surface temperature</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1354-1013</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1365-2486.2006.01255.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Wildfires have major effects on forest dynamics, succession and the carbon cycle in the boreal biome. They are a significant source of carbon emissions, and current observed changes in wildfire regimes due to changes in climate could affect the balance of the boreal carbon pool. A better understanding of postwildfire vegetation dynamics in boreal forests will help predict the future role of boreal forests as a carbon sink or source. Time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Shortwave Infrared Index (NDSWIR) derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Terra satellite were used to investigate whether characteristic temporal patterns exist for stands of different ages in the Siberian boreal forests and whether their postwildfire dynamics are influenced by variables such as prewildfire vegetation cover. Two types of forests, evergreen needle-leaf (ENF) and deciduous needle-leaf (DNF), were studied by analysing a sample of 78 burned forest areas. In order to study a longer time frame, a chronosequence of burned areas of different ages was built by coupling information on location and age provided by a forest burned area database (from 1992 to 2003) to MODIS NDVI and NDSWIR time series acquired from 2001 to 2005. For each of the burned areas, an adjacent unburned control plot representing the same forest type was selected, with the aim of separating the interannual variations caused by climate from changes in NDVI and NDSWIR behaviour due to a wildfire. The results suggest that it takes more than 13 years for the temporal NDVI and NDSWIR signal to recover fully after wildfire. NDSWIR, which is associated to canopy moisture, needs a longer recovery period than NDVI, which is associated to vegetation greenness. The results also suggest that variability observed in postwildfire NDVI and NDSWIR can be explained partially by the dominant forest type: while 13 years after a fire NDVI and NDSWIR are similar for ENF and DNF, the initial impact appears to be greater on the NDVI and NDSWIR of ENF, suggesting a faster recovery by ENF.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70028553</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Busing, Richard T</author><author>Solomon, Allen M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeling the effects of fire frequency and severity on forests in the northwestern United States</title></titles><pages>16-16</pages><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2006-5061</isbn><abstract>.</abstract><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2006/5061/</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhuang, Qianlai</author><author>Melillo, Jerry M.</author><author>Sarofim, Marcus C.</author><author>Kicklighter, David W.</author><author>McGuire, A.

Here we use a process-based model to estimate the budget of CO(2) and CH(4) of the region for current climate conditions and for future scenarios by considering effects of permafrost dynamics, CO(2) fertilization of photosynthesis and fire. We find that currently the region is a net source of carbon to the atmosphere at 276 Tg C yr(-1). We project that throughout the 21st century, the region will most likely continue as a net source of carbon and the source will increase by up to 473 Tg C yr(-1) by the end of the century compared to the current emissions. However our coupled carbon and climate model simulations show that these emissions will exert relatively small radiative forcing on global climate system compared to large amounts of anthropogenic emissions.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70029004</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Randerson, J.

However, evaluation of the long-standing hypotheses about the region’s environmental history has been hampered by the scarcity of paleorecords. We conducted multiproxy analyses on early and middle Holocene sediments from two Illinois, USA, lakes to assess long-term climatic, vegetational, and fire variability in the region. Sediment mineral composition, carbonate d18O, ostracode assemblages, and diatom assemblages were integrated to infer fluctuations in moisture availability. Pollen and charcoal d13C were used to reconstruct vegetation composition, and charcoal influx was used to reconstruct fire. Results indicate that fire-sensitive trees (e.g., Ulmus, Ostrya, Fraxinus, and Acer saccharum) declined and prairie taxa expanded with increased aridity from 10 000 yr BP to 8500 yr BP. Between ;8500 yr BP and ;6200 yr BP, aridity declined, and prairie coexisted with fire-sensitive and fire-tolerant (e.g., Quercus and Carya) trees. After ;6200 yr BP, prairie taxa became dominant, although aridity was not more severe than it was around 8500 yr BP. Along with aridity, fire appears to have played an important role in the establishment and maintenance of prairie communities in the eastern Prairie Peninsula, consistent with the speculations of the early ecologists. Comparison of our data with results from elsewhere in the North American midcontinent indicates that spatial heterogeneity is a characteristic feature of climatic and vegetational variations on millennial time scales.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70028914</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dornblaser, Edited By</author><author>M, Mark</author><author>Halm, Douglas R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Water and sediment quality of the Yukon River and its tributaries, from Eagle to St. Marys, Alaska, 2002-2003</title></titles><pages>2002-2003</pages><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2006-1228</isbn><abstract>The Yukon River basin is a vast and diverse ecosystem covering more than 330,000 square miles, an area larger than Texas. Approximately 126,000 people live within the basin and depend on the Yukon River and its tributaries for drinking water, commerce, and recreational and subsistence fish and game resources. Much of the Yukon River basin is underlain by permafrost containing vast amounts of organic carbon and nutrients. Recent climatic warming of the basin has resulted in lengthening of the growing season, melting of permafrost, deepening of the soil active layer, drying of upland soils, and shrinking of wetlands. These mostly terrestrial effects also affect the hydrology of the basin, changing the timing, magnitude, and fate of water and dissolved and particulate materials delivery to the Yukon River and its tributaries. As permafrost melts, stored carbon and nutrients are expected to become available for decomposition by soil organisms or for export downstream and to the Bering Sea. Such changes can have numerous, far-reaching effects on the ecosystem, including increased emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane; changes in stream productivity, including salmon populations; changes in the productivity and chemistry of the Bering Sea; and increased fire frequency. One important question is whether organic carbon export to rivers will increase or decrease downstream from large wetland areas presently having substantial carbon storage, such as Yukon Flats. Because very few historical water-quality data are available for the Yukon River basin, scientists are unable to quantitatively assess potential effects of climate warming on aquatic ecosystems in the basin. In order to address these concerns, the U.S. Geological Survey conducted a comprehensive baseline water-quality characterization of the Yukon River and its major tributaries during 2000-05. The study included frequent water-quality sampling at a fixed-site network. In addition to the fixed-site sampling, intensive synoptic sampling of tributaries draining directly into the Yukon River was conducted along its entire length. This report contains observations of water and sediment quality made in the Yukon River basin during the synoptic sampling cruises in years 2002 and 2003. Chemical and biological data are presented for the Yukon River and its major tributaries between the towns of Eagle and St. Marys, Alaska.</abstract><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2006/1228/%5Cnhttp://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20061228</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brooks, M.

Management of alien plants is hampered by a lack of information regarding the dominance and environmental correlates of these species. The results of this study indicate that alien plant species comprised a small fraction of the total annual plant flora, but most of the annual plant community biomass. When rainfall was high in 1995, aliens comprised 6% of the flora and 66% of the biomass. When rainfall was low in 1999, aliens comprised 27% of the flora and 91% of the biomass. Bromus rubens, Schismus spp. (S. arabicus and S. barbatus), and Erodium cicutarium were the predominant alien species during both years, comprising 99% of the alien biomass. B. rubens was more abundant in relatively mesic microhabitats beneath shrub canopies and at higher elevations above 800-1000 m, whereas Schismus spp. and E. cicutarium were more abundant in the relatively arid interspaces between shrubs, and, for Schismus spp., at lower elevations as well. Disturbance variables were more reliable indicators of alien dominance than were productivity or native plant diversity variables, although relationships often varied between years of contrasting rainfall. The strongest environmental correlates occurred between dirt road density and alien species richness and biomass of E. cicutarium, and between frequency and size of fires and biomass of B. rubens.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70028621</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Middleton, Beth a.</author><author>Holsten, Bettina</author><author>van Diggelen, Rudy</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biodiversity management of fens and fen meadows by grazing , cutting and burning</title><secondary-title>Applied Vegetation Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Applied Vegetation Science</full-title></periodical><pages>307-316</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>Noss 1994</issue><keywords><keyword>fire</keyword><keyword>cattle grazing</keyword><keyword>mowing</keyword><keyword>plant species richness</keyword><keyword>sedge meadow</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1402-2001</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1658/1402-2001(2006)9[307:bmofaf]2.0.co;2</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Question: Can the biodiversity of fens in Europe and North America be maintained through the use of grazing (especially cattle grazing), fire, and/or cutting? Location: European and North American fens. Methods: This paper is a review of the literature on the effects of grazing, fire and cutting on fens, to explore the relationship between management and biodiversity in fens. Results: A reduction of cattle grazing, mowing and burning in fens has led to a reduction in biodiversity in fens. The vegeta- tion of abandoned fens shifts to trees and shrubs after 10-15 years, which shade the smaller and rarer species of these wetlands. While careful use of fire is used to manage fens in North America, it is not widely used in European fens, perhaps because the peat of drained fens may catch fire. Cattle grazing cannot be considered a natural disturbance in North America, since cattle did not evolve on that continent. In Europe, cattle do not generally graze in unaltered fens, but they do use slightly drained fen meadows. Conclusions: Three approaches have been used to control the dominance of tall woody and herbaceous species in aban- doned fens, including the re-introduction of cattle, mowing, and burning. Overgrazing results in a permanent reduction in biodiversity, therefore cattle re-introduction must be ap- proached cautiously. In Europe, but not in North America, mowing has been an important management tool, and mowing has been successful in maintaining species richness, particularly in fens that have been mowed annually for centuries. Fire has been the most common and successful management tool in North America although it is not effective in removing shrubs that have become large. Because the problems and solutions are similar, the literature of both European and North Ameri- can fen management can be analyzed to better assess the management of fens on both continents. Many management questions require further study and these are listed in the paper.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70028753</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hunter, Molly E.</author><author>Omi, Philip N.</author><author>Martinson, Erik J.</author><author>Chong, Geneva W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Establishment of non-native plant species after wildfires: Effects of fuel treatments, abiotic and biotic factors, and post-fire grass seeding treatments</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</full-title></periodical><pages>271-281</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Ponderosa pine</keyword><keyword>Colorado</keyword><keyword>New Mexico</keyword><keyword>Prescribed fire</keyword><keyword>Rehabilitation</keyword><keyword>Thinning</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1049-8001</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1071/WF05074</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Establishment and spread of non-native species following wildfires can pose threats to long-term native plant recovery. Factors such as disturbance severity, resource availability, and propagule pressure may influence where non-native species establish in burned areas. In addition, pre- and post-fire management activities may influence the likelihood of non-native species establishment. In the present study we examine the establishment of non-native species after wildfires in relation to native species richness, fire severity, dominant native plant cover, resource availability, and pre- and post-fire management actions (fuel treatments and post-fire rehabilitation treatments). We used an information-theoretic approach to compare alternative hypotheses. We analysed post-fire effects at multiple scales at three wildfires in Colorado and New Mexico. For large and small spatial scales at all fires, fire severity was the most consistent predictor of non-native species cover. Non-native species cover was also correlated with high native species richness, low native dominant species cover, and high seeded grass cover. There was a positive, but non-significant, association of non-native species with fuel-treated areas at one wildfire. While there may be some potential for fuels treatments to promote non-native species establishment, wildfire and post-fire seeding treatments seem to have a larger impact on non-native species.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70028362</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Greenberg, Cathryn H.</author><author>Otis, David L.</author><author>Waldrop, Thomas A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Response of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) to fire and fire surrogate fuel reduction treatments in a southern Appalachian hardwood forest</title><secondary-title>Forest Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forest Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>355-362</pages><volume>234</volume><issue>1-3</issue><keywords><keyword>Coarse woody debris</keyword><keyword>Fuel reduction</keyword><keyword>Peromyscus leucopus</keyword><keyword>Prescribed burn</keyword><keyword>Shrub reduction</keyword><keyword>Small mammals</keyword><keyword>White-footed mice</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0378-1127</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.foreco.2006.07.022</electronic-resource-num><abstract>An experiment conducted as part of the multidisciplinary National Fire and Fire Surrogate Study was designed to determine effects of three fuel reduction techniques on small mammals and habitat structure in the southern Appalachian mountains. Four experimental units, each &gt;14-ha were contained within each of three replicate blocks at the Green River Game Land, Polk County, NC. Treatments were (1) prescribed burning (B); (2) mechanical felling of shrubs and small trees (M); (3) mechanical felling + burning (MB); (4) controls (C). Mechanical understory felling treatments were conducted in winter 2001-2002, and prescribed burning was conducted in March 2003. After treatment, there were fewer live trees, more snags, and greater canopy openness in MB than in other treatments. Leaf litter depth was reduced by burning in both B and MB treatments, and tall shrub cover was reduced in all fuel reduction treatments compared to C. Coarse woody debris pieces and percent cover were similar among treatments and controls. We captured 990 individuals of eight rodent species a total of 2823 times. Because white-footed mice composed &gt;79% of all captures, we focused on this species. Populations in experimental units increased 228% on average between 2001 and 2002, but there was no evidence of an effect of the mechanical treatment. From 2002 to 2003, all units again showed an average increase in relative population size, but increases were greater in MB than in the other treatments. Age structure and male to female ratio were not affected by the fuel reduction treatment. Average adult body weight declined from 2001 to 2002, but less so in M than in units that remained C in both years. The proportion of mice captured near coarse woody debris was similar to the proportion captured in open areas for all treatments, indicating that white-footed mice did not use coarse woody debris preferentially or change their use patterns in response to fuel reduction treatments. Land managers should understand possible effects of different fuel reduction treatments on white-footed mouse populations, as they are an important component of the fauna and food chain of deciduous southern Appalachian forests.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70028367</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Grant, Todd A</author><author>Madden, Elizabeth M</author><author>Shaffer, Terry L</author><author>Pietz, Pamela J</author><author>Berkey, Gordon B</author><author>Kadrmas, Neil J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nest Survival of Clay-Colored and Vesper Sparrows in Relation to Woodland Edge in Mixed-Grass Prairies</title><secondary-title>Journal of Wildlife Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Wildlife Management</full-title></periodical><pages>691-701</pages><volume>70</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>aspen woodland</keyword><keyword>clay colored sparrow</keyword><keyword>edge effects</keyword><keyword>grassland birds</keyword><keyword>mixed grass prairie</keyword><keyword>north dakota</keyword><keyword>vesper sparrow</keyword><keyword>woody</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-541X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2193/0022-541X(2006)70[691:NSOCAV]2.0.CO;2</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The quantity and quality of northern mixed-grass prairie continues to decline because of conversion to agriculture, invasion of woody and exotic plants, and disruption of important ecological processes that shape grasslands. Declines in grassland bird populations in North Dakota, USA, have coincided with these largely anthropogenic alterations to prairie habitat. In grasslands of north-central and northwestern North Dakota, woody plants have increased due primarily to fire suppression, extirpation of bison (Bos bison), and widescale planting of tree shelter belts. In northern grasslands, effects of woody vegetation on survival of grassland birds are poorly understood, and conclusions are based mainly on studies conducted outside the region. We examined nest survival of clay-colored sparrows (Spizella pallida) and vesper sparrows (Pooecetes gramineus) relative to the distance nests were located from aspen (Populus tremuloides) woodland edges and relative to other habitat features near the nest. Clay-colored and vesper sparrow nest survival was higher for nests located near woodland edges, nests with greater cover of Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis), and nests more concealed by vegetation. Vesper sparrow nest survival increased as the percent cover of tall shrubs near the nest increased. Based on video-camera data, the 13-lined ground squirrel (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus) was the most common predator of sparrow eggs and young. Thirteen-lined ground squirrels were more common far from woodland edges than near and this pattern may, in part, explain clay-colored and vesper sparrow nest survival in relation to woodland edges. In contrast to our results, studies conducted in other grassland systems generally report lower nest survival for grassland birds nesting near trees and shrubs. This disparity in results demonstrates the need to identify specific nest predators and their distributions with respect to important habitat features because these data can be important in explaining-and perhaps predicting-patterns of nest predation.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.2193/0022-541X(2006)70[691:NSOCAV]2.0.CO;2</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Allen, Jennifer C.</author><author>Krieger, Sharlene M.</author><author>Walters, Jeffrey R.</author><author>Collazo, Jaime A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Associations of Breeding Birds With Fire-Influenced and Riparian – Upland Gradients in a Longleaf Pine Ecosystem</title><secondary-title>The Auk</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Auk</full-title></periodical><pages>1110-1128</pages><volume>123</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>asociaciones de aves reproductivas</keyword><keyword>breeding birds</keyword><keyword>con</keyword><keyword>con áreas infl uenciadas</keyword><keyword>determinamos los efectos de</keyword><keyword>ecosistema de pinus palustris</keyword><keyword>fi re</keyword><keyword>gradientes ribereños</keyword><keyword>la historia del fuego</keyword><keyword>longleaf pine</keyword><keyword>pinus palustris</keyword><keyword>por el fuego y</keyword><keyword>riparian habitat</keyword><keyword>rђѡѣњђћ</keyword><keyword>tierras altas en un</keyword><keyword>y de un gradi-</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1642/0004-8038(2006)123[1110:AOBBWF]2.0.CO;2</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70028437</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pausas, J.

Because several indicators suggest a stronger selective pressure for such traits in California than in the Mediterranean Basin, we hypothesize that plant species should have evolved to become R+ and P+ more frequently in California than in the Mediterranean Basin. 2 To test this hypothesis we studied the phylogenetic association between R and P states in both California and the Mediterranean Basin using published molecular phylogenies. 3 The results suggest that R and P evolved differently in the two regions. The occurrence of the states differs significantly between regions for trait P, but not for trait R. The different patterns (towards R+ and P+ in California and towards R+ and P– in the Mediterranean Basin) are reflected in the higher abundance and the wider taxonomic distribution of species with both persistence traits (R+P+ species) in California. 4 The differential acquisition of fire persistence mechanisms at the propagule level (P+) supports the idea that fire selective pressures has been higher in California than in the Mediterranean Basin. 5 Our comparative phylogenetic-informed analysis contributes to an understanding of the differential role of the Quaternary climate in determining fire persistence traits in different Mediterranean-type ecosystems and, thus, to the debate on the evolutionary convergence of traits.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70030913</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Verdi, Richard Jay</author><author>Tomlinson, Stewart a</author><author>Marella, Richard L</author><author>Florida.

Land- slides on the hillside directly threaten human safety, residential structures, a county roadway, utilities, and the Florida River, and indirectly threaten downstream areas and Lemon Dam. Most of the area where the landslides occurred was burned during the 2002 Missionary Ridge wildfire. We performed geologic mapping, subsurface exploration and sampling, radiocarbon dating, and shallow ground-water and ground- displacement monitoring to assess landslide activity. Active landslides during spring 2005 were as large as 35,000 m3 and confined to colluvium. Debris flows were mobilized from most of the landslides, were as large as 1,500 m3 , and traveled as far as 250 m. Landslide activity was triggered by elevated ground- water pressures within the colluvium caused by infiltration of snowmelt. Landslide activity ceased as ground-water pressures dropped during the summer. Shallow landslides on the hillside appear to be much more likely following the Missionary Ridge fire because of the loss of tree root strength and evapotranspi- ration. We used monitoring data and observations to develop preliminary, approximate rainfall/snowmelt thresholds above which shallow landslide activity can be expected. Landslides triggered during spring 2005 occurred within a 1.97 x 107 m3 older landslide that extends, on average, about 40 m into bedrock. The south end of this older landslide appears to have experienced deep secondary landsliding. Radiocarbon dating of sediments at the head of the older landslide suggests that the landslide was active about 1,424-1,696 years ago. A relatively widespread wildfire may have preceded the older landslide, and the landslide may have occurred during a wetter time. The wet- ter climate and effects of the wildfire would likely have resulted in increased ground-water pressures, which may have triggered the older landslide. This landslide appears to have crossed the valley floor and been subsequently eroded from this area. We found no evidence that landslide debris across the valley floor formed an impoundment of the Florida River, although it is very likely. Erosion of buttressing landslide debris from the valley floor and the lower strength of the landslide basal shear zone relative to pre-slide strength created less stable conditions than were present prior to occurrence of the landslide. However, deep ground-water conditions largely control the stability of the slope and are unknown here; hence, the potential for future deep landsliding is unknown. Additional investigation could be undertaken to further characterize landslide hazards in the area. This investigation could include episodic surveying of monuments we installed across the older landslide, obtaining detailed topographic data and aerial photography, mapping landslide debris and lacustrine deposits related to the potential former landslide dam, mapping secondary landslides, obtaining additional ages of landslide activity, constructing deep boreholes and ground-water monitoring wells, laboratory testing of soil and rock strength and hydraulic properties, and ground- water and slope-stability modeling.</abstract><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20061343</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Laughlin, Daniel C.</author><author>Grace, James B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A multivariate model of plant species richness in forested systems: Old-growth montane forests with a long history of fire</title><secondary-title>Oikos</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oikos</full-title></periodical><pages>60-70</pages><volume>114</volume><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0030-1299</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.0030-1299.2006.14424.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Recently, efforts to develop multivariate models of plant species richness have been extended to include systems where trees play important roles as overstory elements mediating the influences of environment and disturbance on understory richness. We used structural equation modeling to examine the relationship of understory vascular plant species richness to understory abundance, forest structure, topographic slope, and surface fire history in lower montane forests on the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park, USA based on data from eighty-two 0.1 ha plots. The questions of primary interest in this analysis were: (1) to what degree are influences of trees on understory richness mediated by effects on understory abundance? (2) To what degree are influences of fire history on richness mediated by effects on trees and/or understory abundance? (3) Can the influences of fire history on this system be related simply to time-since-fire or are there unique influences associated with long-term fire frequency? The results we obtained are consistent with the following inferences. First, it appears that pine trees had a strong inhibitory effect on the abundance of understory plants, which in turn led to lower understory species richness. Second, richness declined over time since the last fire. This pattern appears to result from several processes, including (1) a post-fire stimulation of germination, (2) a decline in understory abundance, and (3) an increase over time in pine abundance (which indirectly leads to reduced richness). Finally, once time-since-fire was statistically controlled, it was seen that areas with higher fire frequency have lower richness than expected, which appears to result from negative effects on understory abundance, possibly by depletions of soil nutrients from repeated surface fire. Overall, it appears that at large temporal and spatial scales, surface fire plays an important and complex role in structuring understory plant communities in old-growth montane forests. These results show how multivariate models of herbaceous richness can be expanded to apply to forested systems.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70028513</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><titles><title>Wildfire Hazards - A National Threat</title></titles><pages>2-2</pages><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2006-3015</isbn><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/fs20063015</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Allen, Craig D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Re-seeding research will help in cheatgrass battle</title><secondary-title>BLM Snapshots</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BLM Snapshots</full-title></periodical><pages>2-2</pages><volume>February 2</volume><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70180816</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hossack, Blake R.</author><author>Corn, Paul Stephen</author><author>Fagre, Daniel B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Divergent patterns of abundance and age-class structure of headwater stream tadpoles in burned and unburned watersheds</title><secondary-title>Canadian Journal of Zoology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canadian Journal of Zoology</full-title></periodical><pages>1482-1488</pages><volume>84</volume><issue>10</issue><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4301</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/z06-143</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Wildfire is a potential threat to many species with narrow environmental tolerances like the Rocky Mountain tailed frog (Ascaphlls montanlls Mittleman and Myers, 1949), which inhabits a region where the frequency and intensity of wildfires are expected to increase. We compared pre- and post-fire counts of tadpoles in eight streams in northwestem Montana to determine the effects of wildfire on A. montanus. All streams were initially sampled in 2001, 2 years before four of them bumed in a large wildfire, and were resampled during the 2 years follo\ving the fire. Counts of tadpoles were similar in the 1\\'0 groups of streams before the fire. After the fire, tadpoles were almost twice as abundant in unbumed streams than in bumed streams. The fire seemed to have the greatest negative effect on abundance of age-l tadpoles, which was reflected in the greater variation in same-stream age-class structure compared with those in unbumed streams. Despite the apparent effect on tadpoles, we do not expect the wildfire to be an extirpation threat to populations in the streams that we sampled. Studies spanning a chronosequence of fires, as well as in other areas, are needed to assess the ef- fects of fires on streams with A. montallus and to determine the severity and persistence of these effects.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/10.1139/z06-143</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schuler, Krysten L.</author><author>Leslie, David M.</author><author>Shaw, James H.</author><author>Maichak, Eric J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Temporal–Spatial Distribution of American Bison (Bison Bison) in a Tallgrass Prairie Fire Mosaic</title><secondary-title>Journal of Mammalogy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Mammalogy</full-title></periodical><pages>539-544</pages><volume>87</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire</keyword><keyword>Bison</keyword><keyword>Bison bison</keyword><keyword>Distribution</keyword><keyword>Oklahoma</keyword><keyword>Patch-burn mosaic</keyword><keyword>Season</keyword><keyword>Tallgrass prairie</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-2372</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1644/05-MAMM-A-115R2.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fire and bison (Bison bison) are thought to be historically responsible for shaping prairie vegetation in North America. Interactions between temporal-spatial distributions of bison and prescribed burning protocols are important in current restoration of tallgrass prairies. We examined dynamics of bison distribution in a patch-burned tallgrass prairie in the south-central United States relative to bison group size and composition, and burn age and temporal distribution. Bison formed larger mixed groups during summer and smaller sexually segregated groups the rest of the year, and bison selected dormant-season burn patches in the 1st posture growing season most often during spring and summer. Large bison herds selecting recently burned areas resulted in seasonally variable and concentrated grazing pressure that may substantially alter site-specific vegetation. These dynamics must be considered when reintroducing bison and fire into tallgrass prairie because variable outcomes of floral richness and structural complexity are likely depending on temporal-spatial distribution of bison. © 2006 American Society of Mammalogists.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-33745151982&amp;partnerID=tZOtx3y1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Wagtendonk, J W</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Wuerthner, G</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Fire ecology of the Sierra Nevada</title><secondary-title>Fire - Restoring Fire to the Land - Fire Ecology and Forest Health.</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Fire - Restoring Fire to the Land - Fire Ecology and Forest Health.</full-title></periodical><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Sausalito, CA</pub-location><publisher>Foundation for Deep Ecology</publisher><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/81598</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Peterjohn, Bruce G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Conceptual ecological model for management of breeding shrubland birds in the Mid-Atlantic Region</title></titles><pages>74-74</pages><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Philadelphia, PA</pub-location><isbn>NPS/NER/NRTR--2006/043</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70176689</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Knapp, Eric E.</author><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Heterogeneity in fire severity within early season and late season prescribed burns in a mixed-conifer forest</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</full-title></periodical><pages>37-45</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Prescribed fire</keyword><keyword>Fire ecology</keyword><keyword>Landscape heterogeneity</keyword><keyword>Season of burning</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1049-8001</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1071/WF04068</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Structural heterogeneity in forests of the Sierra Nevada was historically produced through variation in fire regimes and local environmental factors. The amount of heterogeneity that prescription burning can achieve might now be more limited owing to high fuel loads and increased fuel continuity. Topography, woody fuel loading, and vegetative composition were quantified in plots within replicated early and late season burn units. Two indices of fire severity were evaluated in the same plots after the burns. Scorch height ranged from 2.8 to 25.4 m in early season plots and 3.1 to 38.5 m in late season plots, whereas percentage of ground surface burned ranged from 24 to 96% in early season plots and from 47 to 100% in late season plots. Scorch height was greatest in areas with steeper slopes, higher basal area of live trees, high percentage of basal area composed of pine, and more small woody fuel. Percentage of area burned was greatest in areas with less bare ground and rock cover (more fuel continuity), steeper slopes, and units burned in the fall (lower fuel moisture). Thus topographic and biotic factors still contribute to the abundant heterogeneity in fire severity with prescribed burning, even under the current high fuel loading conditions. Burning areas with high fuel loads in early season when fuels are moister may lead to patterns of heterogeneity in fire effects that more closely approximate the expected patchiness of historical fires.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/1008362</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sah, Jay P.</author><author>Ross, Michael S.</author><author>Snyder, James R.</author><author>Koptur, Suzanne</author><author>Cooley, Hillary C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fuel loads, fire regimes, and post-fire fuel dynamics in Florida Keys pine forests</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</full-title></periodical><pages>463-478</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Prescribed fire</keyword><keyword>Char height</keyword><keyword>Fuel consumption</keyword><keyword>Path analysis</keyword><keyword>Pine rocklands</keyword><keyword>Slash pine</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1049-8001</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1071/WF05100</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In forests, the effects of different life forms on fire behavior may vary depending on their contributions to total fuel loads. We examined the distribution of fuel components before fire, their effects on fire behavior, and the effects of fire on subsequent fuel recovery in pine forests within the National Key Deer Refuge in the Florida Keys. We conducted a burning experiment in six blocks, within each of which we assigned 1-ha plots to three treatments: control, summer, and winter burn. Owing to logistical constraints, we burned only 11 plots, three in winter and eight in summer, over a 4-year period from 1998 to 2001. We used path analysis to model the effects of fuel type and char height, an indicator of fire intensity, on fuel consumption. Fire intensity increased with surface fuel loads, but was negatively related to the quantity of hardwood shrub fuels, probably because these fuels are associated with a moist microenvironment within hardwood patches, and therefore tend to resist fire. Winter fires were milder than summer fires, and were less effective at inhibiting shrub encroachment. A mixed seasonal approach is suggested for fire management, with burns applied opportunistically under a range of winter and summer conditions, but more frequently than that prevalent in the recent past.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70028687</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhu, Zhi-Liang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>LANDFIRE: Collaboration for National Fire Fuel Assessment</title></titles><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2006-3019</isbn><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/fs20063019</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>KIRKPATRICK, CHRIS</author><author>CONWAY, COURTNEY J.</author><author>JONES, PATRICIA B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Distribution and Relative Abundance of Forest Birds in Relation to Burn Severity in Southeastern Arizona</title><secondary-title>Journal of Wildlife Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Wildlife Management</full-title></periodical><pages>1005-1012</pages><volume>70</volume><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2193/0022-541X(2006)70[1005:DARAOF]2.0.CO;2</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The frequency of wild and prescribed fires in montane forests of the southwestern United States has increased after a century of fire suppression and subsequent fuels accumulation. To assess the effects of recent fires (median time since fire = 6 yr) on the montane forest bird community, we surveyed birds in 8 Sky Island mountain ranges in southeastern Arizona, USA, and examined how the distribution (i.e., presence-absence) of 65 species and relative abundance of 16 species correlated with evidence of severe and less severe fire at &gt; 1,500 survey points. We detected associations between fire and bird presence-absence for 17% of the 65 species analyzed and between fire and bird relative abundance for 25% of the 16 species analyzed. Most species (73%) were positively associated with burned areas and displayed stronger associations (i.e., more extreme odds ratios) with survey points that had evidence of severe as opposed to less severe fire. Positive associations with severe fire were strong 3 to 1 odds) for western wood-pewee (Contopus sordidulus) and house wren (Troglodytes aedon), and negative associations with severe fire were strong for warbling vireo (Vireo gilvus) and red-breasted nuthatch (Sitta canadensis). Although recent fires appear to have had a positive effect on the distribution and relative abundance of several montane forest bird species in the region, these species are not the open-woodland birds that we would have expected to have benefited from fire based on previous research. Nevertheless, our results confirm associations between fire and bird presence-absence and relative abundance reported previously for 7 species of birds. Our results also provide new information for Grace's warbler Dendroica graciae) and greater pewee (C. pertinax), 2 species for which fire data were formerly lacking. Managers can use these data to make and test predictions about the effects of future fires, both severe and less severe, on montane forest birds in the southwestern United States.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.2193/0022-541X%282006%2970%5B1005%3ADARAOF%5D2.0.CO%3B2</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Parker, John T C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Post-Wildfire Sedimentation in Saguaro National Park, Rincon Mountain District, and Effects on Lowland Leopard Frog Habitat</title></titles><pages>41-41</pages><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2006-5235</isbn><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20065235</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Key, Carl H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ecological and Sampling Constraints on Defining Landscape Fire Severity</title><secondary-title>Fire Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Fire Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>34-59</pages><volume>2</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>fire</keyword><keyword>2</keyword><keyword>2006</keyword><keyword>34 - 59</keyword><keyword>burn</keyword><keyword>c</keyword><keyword>change</keyword><keyword>citation</keyword><keyword>detection</keyword><keyword>differenced normalized burn ratio</keyword><keyword>dnbr</keyword><keyword>ecological and sampling constraints</keyword><keyword>etm</keyword><keyword>fire ecology</keyword><keyword>fire effects</keyword><keyword>h</keyword><keyword>key</keyword><keyword>landsat tm</keyword><keyword>on defining landscape fire</keyword><keyword>severity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1933-9747</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.4996/fireecology.0202034</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Ecological definition and detection of fire severity are influenced by factors of spatial resolution and timing. Resolution determines the aggregation of effects within a sampling unit or pixel (alpha variation), hence limiting the discernible ecological responses, and controlling the spatial patchiness of responses distributed throughout a burn (beta variation). As resolution decreases, alpha variation increases, extracting beta variation and complexity from the spatial model of the whole burn. Seasonal timing impacts the quality of radiometric data in terms of transmittance, sun angle, and potential contrast between responses within burns. Detection sensitivity can degrade toward the end of many fire seasons when low sun angles, vegetation senescence, incomplete burning, hazy conditions, or snow are common. Thus, a need exists to supersede many rapid response applications when remote sensing conditions improve. Lag timing, or time since fire, notably shapes the ecological character of severity through first-order effects that only emerge with time after fire, including delayed survivorship and mortality. Survivorship diminishes the detected magnitude of severity, as burned vegetation remains viable and resprouts, though at first it may appear completely charred or consumed above ground. Conversely, delayed mortality increases the severity estimate when apparently healthy vegetation is in fact damaged by heat to the extent that it dies over time. Both responses depend on fire behavior and various species-specific adaptations to fire that are unique to the pre-fire composition of each burned area. Both responses can lead initially to either over- or under- estimating severity. Based on such implications, three sampling intervals for short-term burn severity are identified; rapid, initial, and extended assessment, sampled within about two weeks, two months, and depending on the ecotype, from three months to one year after fire, respectively. Spatial and temporal conditions of sampling strategies constrain data quality and ecological information obtained about fire severity. Though commonly overlooked, such considerations determine the objectives and hypotheses that are appropriate for each application, and are especially important when building comparative studies or long-term reference databases on fire severity.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://fireecologyjournal.org/journal/abstract/?abstract=18</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chastain, RA</author><author>Struckhoff, MA</author><author>Grabner, KW</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mapping vegetation communities in Ozark National Scenic Riverways: final technical report to the National Park Service</title></titles><pages>178-178</pages><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2006-1354</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ecrc.usgs.gov/pubs/center/pdfDocs/MapVegONSR.pdf</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Beever, E.

Across this broad spatial domain (3.03 million ha), we minimized confounding due to abiotic factors by selecting horse-occupied and horse-removed sites with similar aspect, slope, fire history, grazing pressure by cattle (minimal to none), and dominant vegetation (Artemisia tridentata). During both 1997 and 1998, we found 2.2-8.4 times greater abundance of ant mounds and 3.0-15.4 times lower penetration resistance in soil surfaces at horse-removed sites. In 1998, thatched Formica ant mounds, which existed predominately at high elevations, were 3.3 times more abundant at horse-removed sites, although abundance varied widely among sites within treatments. Several types of analyses suggested that horses rather than environmental variability were the primary source of treatment differences we observed in ecosystem components. Tests of several predictions suggest that alterations occurred through not only direct effects, but also indirect effects and potentially feedback loops. Free-roaming horses as well as domestic grazers should be considered in conservation planning and land management in the Great Basin, an ecoregion that represents both an outstanding conservation opportunity and challenge.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70028512</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database

examine the impacts of a stand-clearing wildfire on the characteristics and magnitude of suspended sediment transport in ephemeral streams draining the burn area. We report the results of a monitoring program that includes 2 years of data prior to the Cerro Grande fire in New Mexico, and 3 years of postfire data. Suspended sediment concentration (SSC) increased by about 2 orders of magnitude following the fire, and the proportion of silt and clay increased from 50% to 80%. For a given flow event, SSC is highest at the flood bore and decreases monotonically with time, a pattern evident in every flood sampled both before and after the fire. We propose that the accumulation of flow and wash load at the flow front is an inherent characteristic of ephemeral stream flows, due to amplified momentum losses at the flood bore. We present a new model for computing suspended sediment transport in ephemeral streams (in the presence or absence of wildfire) by relating SSC to the time following the arrival of the flood bore, rather than to instantaneous discharge. Using this model and a rainfall history, we estimate that in the 3 years following the fire, floods transported in suspension a mass equivalent to about 3 mm of landscape lowering across the burn area, 20% of this following a single rainstorm. We test the model by computing fine sediment delivery to a small reservoir in an adjacent watershed, where we have a detailed record of postfire sedimentation based on repeat surveys. Systematic discrepancies between modeled and measured sedimentation rates in the reservoir suggest rapid reductions in suspended sediment delivery in the first several years after the fire.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70030110</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vogel, Jennifer A.</author><author>Debinski, Diane M.</author><author>Koford, Rolf R.</author><author>Miller, James R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Butterfly responses to prairie restoration through fire and grazing</title><secondary-title>Biological Conservation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biological Conservation</full-title></periodical><pages>78-90</pages><volume>140</volume><issue>1-2</issue><keywords><keyword>Tallgrass prairie</keyword><keyword>Burning</keyword><keyword>Butterflies</keyword><keyword>Grazing</keyword><keyword>Insect conservation</keyword><keyword>Restoration</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0006-3207</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.biocon.2007.07.027</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The development of land for modern agriculture has resulted in losses of native prairie habitat. The small, isolated patches of prairie habitat that remain are threatened by fire suppression, overgrazing, and invasion by non-native species. We evaluated the effects of three restoration practices (grazing only, burning only, and burning and grazing) on the vegetation characteristics and butterfly communities of remnant prairies. Total butterfly abundance was highest on prairies that were managed with burning and grazing and lowest on those that were only burned. Butterfly species richness did not differ among any of the restoration practices. Butterfly species diversity was highest on sites that were only burned. Responses of individual butterfly species to restoration practices were highly variable. In the best predictive regression model, total butterfly abundance was negatively associated with the percent cover of bare ground and positively associated with the percent cover of forbs. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that sites with burned only and grazed only practices could be separated based on their butterfly community composition. Butterfly communities in each of the three restoration practices are equally species rich but different practices yield compositionally different butterfly communities. Because of this variation in butterfly species responses to different restoration practices, there is no single practice that will benefit all species or even all species within habitat-specialist or habitat-generalist habitat guilds. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

To quantify avian response patterns along a burn severity gradient, we sampled 49 random plots ( 2001 - 2002) at the 17351- ha Cerro Grande Fire ( 2000) in New Mexico, USA. Additionally, pre-. re avian surveys ( 1986 1988, 1990) created a unique opportunity to quantify avifaunal changes in 13 pre-. re transects ( resampled in 2002) and to compare two designs for analyzing the effects of unplanned disturbances: after- only analysis and before - after comparisons. Distance analysis was used to calculate densities. We analyzed after- only densities for 21 species using gradient analysis, which detected a broad range of responses to increasing burn severity: (I) large significant declines, (II) weak, but signi. cant declines, (III) no signi. cant density changes, (IV) peak densities in low- or moderate- severity patches, (V) weak, but signi. cant increases, and (VI) large signi. cant increases. Overall, 71% of the species included in the after- only gradient analysis exhibited either positive or neutral density responses to. re effects across all or portions of the severity gradient ( responses III - VI). We used pre/ post pairs analysis to quantify density changes for 15 species using before - after comparisons; spatiotemporal variation in densities was large and confounded. re effects for most species. Only four species demonstrated signi. cant effects of burn severity, and their densities were all higher in burned compared to unburned forests. Pre- and post-. re community similarity was high except in high- severity areas. Species richness was similar pre- and post-. re across all burn severities. Thus, ecosystem restoration programs based on the assumption that recent severe. res in Southwestern ponderosa pine forests have overriding negative ecological effects are not supported by our study of post-. re avian communities. This study illustrates the importance of quantifying burn severity and controlling confounding sources of spatiotemporal variation in studies of. re effects. After- only gradient analysis can be an efficient tool for quantifying. re effects. This analysis can also augment historical data sets that have small samples sizes coupled with high non- process variation, which limits the power of before - after comparisons.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70033247</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Saatchi, Sassan</author><author>Halligan, Kerry</author><author>Despain, Don G.</author><author>Crabtree, Robert L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimation of forest fuel load from radar remote sensing</title><secondary-title>IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing</full-title></periodical><pages>1726-1740</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Canopy bulk density</keyword><keyword>Canopy fuel</keyword><keyword>Forest biomass</keyword><keyword>Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR)</keyword><keyword>Radar</keyword><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Yellowstone National Park (YNP)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0196-2892</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/TGRS.2006.887002</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Understanding fire behavior characteristics and planning for fire management require maps showing the distribution of wildfire fuel loads at medium to fine spatial resolution across large landscapes. Radar sensors from airborne or spaceborne platforms have the potential of providing quantitative information about the forest structure and biomass components that can be readily translated to meaningful fuel load estimates for fire management. In this paper, we used multifrequency polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery acquired over a large area of the Yellowstone National Park by the Airborne SAR sensor to estimate the distribution of forest biomass and canopy fuel loads. Semiempirical algorithms were developed to estimate crown and stem biomass and three major fuel load parameters, namely: 1) canopy fuel weight; 2) canopy bulk density; and 3) foliage moisture content. These estimates, when compared directly to measurements made at plot and stand levels, provided more than 70% accuracy and, when partitioned into fuel load classes, provided more than 85% accuracy. Specifically, the radar-generated fuel parameters were in good agreement with the field-based fuel measurements, resulting in coefficients of determination of R2=85 for the canopy fuel weight, R2 =0.84 for canopy bulk density, and R2=0.78 for the foliage biomass</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70030146</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author><author>McGinnis, Thomas W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of prescribed fire and other factors on cheatgrass persistence in a Sierra Nevada ponderosa pine forest</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</full-title></periodical><pages>96-106</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Aliens</keyword><keyword>Bromus tectorum</keyword><keyword>Downy brome</keyword><keyword>Fire intensity</keyword><keyword>Non-native</keyword><keyword>Structural equation modelling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1049-8001</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1071/WF06052</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Following the reintroduction of fire Bromus tectorum has invaded the low elevation ponderosa pine forests in parts of Kings Canyon National Park, California. We used prescribed burns, other field manipulations, germination studies, and structural equation modelling, to investigate how fire and other factors affect the persistence of cheatgrass in these forests. Our studies show that altering burning season to coincide with seed maturation is not likely to control cheatgrass because sparse fuel loads generate low fire intensity. Increasing time between prescribed fires may inhibit cheatgrass by increasing surface fuels (both herbaceous and litter), which directly inhibit cheatgrass establishment, and by creating higher intensity fires capable of killing a much greater fraction of the seed bank. Using structural equation modelling, postfire cheatgrass dominance was shown to be most strongly controlled by the prefire cheatgrass seedbank; other factors include soil moisture, fire intensity, soil N, and duration of direct sunlight. Current fire management goals in western conifer forests are focused on restoring historical fire regimes; however, these frequent fire regimes may enhance alien plant invasion in some forest types. Where feasible, fire managers should consider the option of an appropriate compromise between reducing serious fire hazards and exacerbating alien plant invasions.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70031932</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keane, Robert E.</author><author>Rollins, Matthew</author><author>Zhu, Zhi Liang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using simulated historical time series to prioritize fuel treatments on landscapes across the United States: The LANDFIRE prototype project</title><secondary-title>Ecological Modelling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Modelling</full-title></periodical><pages>485-502</pages><volume>204</volume><issue>3-4</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire management</keyword><keyword>Fire regimes</keyword><keyword>Historical range and variation</keyword><keyword>Integrated ecological modeling</keyword><keyword>LANDFIRE</keyword><keyword>Landscape modeling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0304-3800</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2007.02.005</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Canopy and surface fuels in many fire-prone forests of the United States have increased over the last 70 years as a result of modern fire exclusion policies, grazing, and other land management activities. The Healthy Forest Restoration Act and National Fire Plan establish a national commitment to reduce fire hazard and restore fire-adapted ecosystems across the USA. The primary index used to prioritize treatment areas across the nation is Fire Regime Condition Class (FRCC) computed as departures of current conditions from the historical fire and landscape conditions. This paper describes a process that uses an extensive set of ecological models to map FRCC from a departure statistic computed from simulated time series of historical landscape composition. This mapping process uses a data-driven, biophysical approach where georeferenced field data, biogeochemical simulation models, and spatial data libraries are integrated using spatial statistical modeling to map environmental gradients that are then used to predict vegetation and fuels characteristics over space. These characteristics are then fed into a landscape fire and succession simulation model to simulate a time series of historical landscape compositions that are then compared to the composition of current landscapes to compute departure, and the FRCC values. Intermediate products from this process are then used to create ancillary vegetation, fuels, and fire regime layers that are useful in the eventual planning and implementation of fuel and restoration treatments at local scales. The complex integration of varied ecological models at different scales is described and problems encountered during the implementation of this process in the LANDFIRE prototype project are addressed. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The federal government expends significant resources implementing ES&amp;R and BAER treatments after wildfires; however, recent reviews have found that existing data from monitoring and research are insufficient to evaluate the effects of these activities. The purpose of this report is to: (1) document what monitoring methods are generally used by personnel in the field; (2) describe approaches and methods for post- fire vegetation and soil monitoring documented in agency manuals; (3) determine the common elements of monitoring programs recommended in these manuals; and (4) describe a common monitoring approach to determine the effectiveness of future ES&amp;R and BAER treatments in non-forested regions. Both qualitative and quantitative methods to measure effectiveness of ES&amp;R treatments are used by federal land management agencies. Quantitative methods are used in the field depending on factors such as funding, personnel, and time constraints. There are seven vegetation monitoring manuals produced by the federal government that address monitoring methods for (primarily) vegetation and soil attributes. These methods vary in their objectivity and repeatability. The most repeatable methods are point-intercept, quadrat-based density measurements, gap intercepts, and direct measurement of soil erosion. Additionally, these manuals recommend approaches for designing monitoring programs for the state of ecosystems or the effect of management actions. The elements of a defensible monitoring program applicable to ES&amp;R and BAER projects that most of these manuals have in common are objectives, stratification, control areas, random sampling, data quality, and statistical analysis. The effectiveness of treatments can be determined more accurately if data are gathered using an approach that incorporates these six monitoring program design elements and objectives, as well as repeatable procedures to measure cover, density, gap intercept, and soil erosion within each ecoregion and plant community. Additionally, using a common monitoring program design with comparable methods, consistently documenting results, and creating and maintaining a central database for query and reporting, will ultimately allow a determination of the effectiveness of post- fire rehabilitation activities region-wide.</abstract><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20065048</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Owens, Alaina B.</author><author>Proffitt, C.

Iva frutescens proved to be extremely hardy, with zero mortality following the cutting, burning, or combination treatment; similar levels of regrowth were observed for all treatments. Individual shrub response, however, was found to be related to initial plant size, ground water level and salinity, and two fire characteristics (total heating &gt;60°C and total heat index &gt;60°C).

Fire and herbivory effects on the nutritive quality of savanna vegetation can occur directly, independent of changes in the plant community, or indirectly, via effects on the plant community. Indirect effects can be further subdivided into those occurring because of changes in plant species composition or plant abundance (i.e., quality versus quantity). We studied relationships between fire, herbivory, rainfall, soil fertility, and leaf nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sodium (Na) at 30 sites inside and outside of Serengeti National Park. Using structural equation modeling, we asked whether fire and herbivory influences were largely direct or indirect and how their signs and strengths differed within the context of natural savanna processes. Herbivory was associated with enhanced leaf N and P through changes in plant biomass and community composition. Fire was associated with reduced leaf nutrient concentrations through changes in plant community composition. Additionally, fire had direct positive effects on Na and nonlinear direct effects on P that partially mitigated the indirect negative effects. Key mechanisms by which fire reduced plant nutritive quality were through reductions of Na-rich grasses and increased abundance of Themeda triandra, which had below-average leaf nutrients.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/520120</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Allen, Craig D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interactions across spatial scales among forest dieback, fire, and erosion in northern New Mexico landscapes</title><secondary-title>Ecosystems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecosystems</full-title></periodical><pages>797-808</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire history</keyword><keyword>Fire</keyword><keyword>New Mexico</keyword><keyword>Cross-scale relationships</keyword><keyword>Disturbance interactions</keyword><keyword>Erosion</keyword><keyword>Forest dieback</keyword><keyword>Southwestern USA</keyword><keyword>Thresholds</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1432-9840\n1435-0629</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10021-007-9057-4</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Ecosystem patterns and disturbance processes at one spatial scale often interact with processes at another scale, and the result of such cross-scale interactions can be nonlinear dynamics with thresholds. Examples of cross-scale pattern-process relationships and interactions among forest dieback, fire, and erosion are illustrated from northern New Mexico (USA) landscapes, where long-term studies have recently documented all of these disturbance processes. For example, environmental stress, operating on individual trees, can cause tree death that is amplified by insect mortality agents to propagate to patch and then landscape or even regional-scale forest dieback. Severe drought and unusual warmth in the southwestern USA since the late 1990s apparently exceeded species-specific physiological thresholds for multiple tree species, resulting in substantial vegetation mortality across millions of hectares of woodlands and forests in recent years. Predictions of forest dieback across spatial scales are constrained by uncertainties associated with: limited knowledge of species-specific physiological thresholds; individual and site-specific variation in these mortality thresholds; and positive feedback loops between rapidly-responding insect herbivore populations and their stressed plant hosts, sometimes resulting in nonlinear “pest” outbreak dynamics. Fire behavior also exhibits nonlinearities across spatial scales, illustrated by changes in historic fire regimes where patch-scale grazing disturbance led to regional-scale collapse of surface fire activity and subsequent recent increases in the scale of extreme fire events in New Mexico. Vegetation dieback interacts with fire activity by modifying fuel amounts and configurations at multiple spatial scales. Runoff and erosion processes are also subject to scale-dependent threshold behaviors, exemplified by ecohydrological work in semiarid New Mexico watersheds showing how declines in ground surface cover lead to non-linear increases in bare patch connectivity and thereby accelerated runoff and erosion at hillslope and watershed scales. Vegetation dieback, grazing, and fire can change land surface properties and cross-scale hydrologic connectivities, directly altering ecohydrological patterns of runoff and erosion. The interactions among disturbance processes across spatial scales can be key drivers in ecosystem dynamics, as illustrated by these studies of recent landscape changes in northern New Mexico. To better anticipate and mitigate accelerating human impacts to the planetary ecosystem at all spatial scales, improvements are needed in our conceptual and quantitative understanding of cross-scale interactions among disturbance processes.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70030846</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Merriam, K E</author><author>Keeley, J E</author><author>Beyers, J L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The role of fuel breaks in the invasion of nonnative plants</title></titles><pages>69-69</pages><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2006-5185</isbn><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20065185</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Knapp, Eric E</author><author>Schwilk, Dylan W</author><author>Kane, Jeffrey M</author><author>Keeley, Jon E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Role of burning season on initial understory vegetation response to prescribed fire in a mixed conifer forest</title><secondary-title>Canadian Journal of Forest Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canadian Journal of Forest Research</full-title></periodical><pages>11-22</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0045-5067</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/x06-200</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Although the majority of fires in the western United States historically\noccurred during the late summer or early fall when fuels were dry\nand plants were dormant or nearly so, early-season prescribed burns\nare often ignited when fuels are still moist and plants are actively\ngrowing.

We evaluated the effects of a large, stand-replacement wildfire on three species of pond-breeding amphibians by estimating changes in occupancy of breeding sites during the three years before and after the fire burned 42 of 83 previously surveyed wetlands. Annual occupancy and colonization for each species was estimated using recently developed models that incorporate detection probabilities to provide unbiased parameter estimates. We did not find negative effects of the fire on the occupancy or colonization rates of the long-toed salamander (Ambystoma macrodactylum). Instead, its occupancy was higher across the study area after the fire, possibly in response to a large snowpack that may have facilitated colonization of unoccupied wetlands. Naıe data (uncorrected for detection probability) for the Columbia spotted frog (Rana luteiventris) initially led to the conclusion of increased occupancy and colonization in wetlands that burned. After accounting for temporal and spatial variation in detection probabilities, however, it was evident that these parameters were relatively stable in both areas before and after the fire. We found a similar discrepancy between naıe and estimated occupancy of A. macrodactylum that resulted from different detection probabilities in burned and control wetlands. The boreal toad (Bufo boreas) was not found breeding in the area prior to the fire but colonized several wetlands the year after they burned. Occupancy by B. boreas then declined during years 2 and 3 following the fire. Our study suggests that the amphibian populations we studied are resistant to wildfire and that B. boreas may experience short-term benefits from wildfire. Our data also illustrate how naıe presence–non-detection data can provide misleading results.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/1008607</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Balshi, M.

To improve our understanding of how wildfire influences carbon dynamics of this region, we used the process-based Terrestrial Ecosystem Model to simulate fire emissions and changes in carbon storage north of 45 degrees N from the start of spatially explicit historically recorded fire records in the twentieth century through 2002, and evaluated the role of fire in the carbon dynamics of the region within the context of ecosystem responses to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate. Our analysis indicates that fire plays an important role in interannual and decadal scale variation of source/sink relationships of northern terrestrial ecosystems and also suggests that atmospheric CO2 may be important to consider in addition to changes in climate and fire disturbance. There are substantial uncertainties in the effects of fire on carbon storage in our simulations. These uncertainties are associated with sparse fire data for northern Eurasia, uncertainty in estimating carbon consumption, and difficulty in verifying assumptions about the representation of fires that occurred prior to the start of the historical fire record.

Samples were collected in zones that were burned in a major wildfire in 1947 and in zones that were not burned. We hypothesized that Hg concentrations in streamwater would be higher from unburned sites than burned watersheds, because fire would volatilize stored Hg. The Hg concentrations, based on burn history, were not statistically distinct. However, significant statistical associations were noted between Hg and the amount of wetlands in the drainage systems and with streamwater dissolved organic carbon (DOC). An unexpected result was that wetlands mobilized more Hg by generating more DOC in total, but upland DOC was more efficient at transporting Hg because it transports more Hg per unit DOC. Mercury concentrations were higher in samples collected at lower elevations. Mercury was positively correlated with relative discharge, although this effect was not distinguished from the DOC association. In this research, sample site elevation and the presence of upstream wetlands and their associated DOC affected Hg concentrations more strongly than burn history.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70033246</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Eidenshink, Jeff</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>USGS Fire Science: Fire Danger Monitoring and Forecasting</title></titles><pages>1-1</pages><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2005-3066</isbn><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/fs20053066</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Busing, Richard T.</author><author>Solomon, Allen M.</author><author>McKane, Robert B.</author><author>Burdick, Connie A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Forest dynamics in Oregon landscapes: Evaluation and application of an individual-based model</title><secondary-title>Ecological Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>1967-1981</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Climate change</keyword><keyword>Fire</keyword><keyword>Forest composition</keyword><keyword>Natural disturbance</keyword><keyword>Pacific northwest</keyword><keyword>Simulation</keyword><keyword>Vegetation</keyword><keyword>Watershed</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1051-0761</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1890/06-1838.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The FORCLIM model of forest dynamics was tested against field survey data for its ability to simulate basal area and composition of old forests across broad climatic gradients in western Oregon, USA. The model was also tested for its ability to capture successional trends in ecoregions of the west Cascade Range. It was then applied to simulate present and future (1990-2050) forest landscape dynamics of a watershed in the west Cascades. Various regimes of climate change and harvesting in the watershed were considered in the landscape application. The model was able to capture much of the variation in forest basal area and composition in western Oregon even though temperature and precipitation were the only inputs that were varied among simulated sites. The measured decline in total basal area from tall coastal forests eastward to interior steppe was matched by simulations. Changes in simulated forest dominants also approximated those in the actual data. Simulated abundances of a few minor species did not match actual abundances, however. Subsequent projections of climate change and harvest effects in a west Cascades landscape indicated no change in forest dominance as of 2050. Yet, climate-driven shifts in the distributions of some species were projected. The simulation of both stand-replacing and partial-stand disturbances across western Oregon improved agreement between simulated and actual data. Simulations with fire as an agent of partial disturbance suggested that frequent fires of low severity can alter forest composition and structure as much or more than severe fires at historic frequencies.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70031272</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Coe, Jeffrey a</author><author>Bigio, Erica R</author><author>Blair Jr., Robert W</author><author>Burke, Michael</author><author>Cannon, Susan H</author><author>DeWolfe, Victor G</author><author>Ey, John</author><author>Gartner, Joseph E</author><author>Gillam, Mary L</author><author>Knowlton, N D Butch</author><author>Santi, Paul M</author><author>Schulz, William H</author><author>Coe, Jeffrey A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mass Wasting Following the 2002 Missionary Ridge Fire near Durango, Colorado, a Field Trip Guidebook</title></titles><pages>54-54</pages><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2007-1289</isbn><abstract>Introduction As the title indicates, this field trip guide will focus on mass wasting following the 2002 Missionary Ridge fire near Durango, Colorado (fig. 1). We prepared this guide to accompany a May 4, 2006, field trip during the second Roy J. Shlemon Specialty Conference, which was held in Durango, Colorado, May 3−5. The conference, entitled Mass Wasting in Disturbed Watersheds, was sponsored by the Association of Environmental &amp; Engineering Geologists (AEG) and the AEG Foundation. The objective of this Shlemon Conference was to bring together practitioners and researchers to define the current state of practice and identify unresolved problems with regard to the prediction and mitigation of mass wasting in disturbed watersheds. The four technical session topics of the conference were (1) post-wildfire mass wasting; (2) logging and mass wasting; (3) mining, urbanization, volcanism, and other disturbances; and (4) emerging technologies and tools (for example, LiDAR, GIS applications, watershed modeling). Shlemon Conferences follow procedures typical of the Geological Society of America Penrose Conferences and the American Geophysical Union Chapman Conferences. Shlemon Conferences are supported, in part, by funds provided by Roy J. Shlemon, a Trustee of the AEG Foundation, an honorary member of the AEG, and a fellow of the Geological Society of America. The conferences provide for an intensive two- to three-day forum of technical discussions among researchers and practitioners, and focus on topics beneficial to society and directly related to application of the engineering and environmental geosciences. The conferences are intended to promote and disseminate practice and research results and to foster improvement and understanding of applied geology. The one-day field trip begins and ends in Durango. Many of the field trip stops are at debris-flow fans around the periphery of the burn area (fig. 1), but one stop examines landslide activity in the burn area that initiated during spring 2005 snowmelt within a dormant, deep-seated landslide, as well as an erosion/debris-flow mitigation effort in a drainage basin above Lemon Reservoir. Stops on fans will focus on (1) erosion and sediment entrainment that caused debris flows in the summer of 2002; (2) Holocene and 2002 debris-flow deposits; and (3) fire history, debris-flow hazards, hazard assessments, and mitigation schemes. A lunch stop provides a geologic overview of the Durango area. In this guidebook we provide a description of the Missionary Ridge fire, the geologic and climatic setting of the field-trip area, the general effects of wildfire on watersheds, a general description of mass wasting following the Missionary Ridge fire, and finally, a road log including descriptions of each stop.</abstract><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20071289</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Raumann, Christian G</author><author>Geological Survey (U.S.)</author><author>Geographic Analysis and Monitoring Program (Geological Survey)</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Land-cover change in the southern Lake Tahoe Basin, California and Nevada, 1940-2002</title></titles><pages>1 electronic map-1 electronic map</pages><keywords><keyword>Lake</keyword><keyword>Land use Tahoe</keyword><keyword>Watershed (Calif. and Nev.)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2962</isbn><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://purl.access.gpo.gov/GPO/LPS93258</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Miller, R.F.</author><author>Bates, J.D.</author><author>Svejcar, T.J.</author><author>Pierson, F.B.</author><author>Eddleman, L.E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Western Juniper Field Guide : Asking the Right Questions to Select Appropriate Management Actions</title></titles><pages>61-61</pages><keywords><keyword>field guide</keyword><keyword>juniper</keyword><keyword>pinion pine</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1321</isbn><abstract>Introduction Introduction Strong evidence indicates that western juniper has significantly expanded its range since the late 1800s by encroaching into landscapes once dominated by shrubs and herbaceous vegetation.

The assessments will be presented as a series of maps showing a relative ranking of the predicted volume of debris flows that can issue from basin outlets in response to a 3-hour duration rainstorm with a 10-year return period. Potential volumes of debris flows are calculated using a multiple-regression model that describes debris-flow volume at a basin outlet as a function of measures of basin gradient, burn extent, and storm rainfall. This assessment provides critical information for issuing basin-specific warnings, locating and designing mitigation measures, and planning of evacuation timing and routes.</abstract><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.science.marshall.edu/Niemann/GLY 456/Landslides/USGS burn area debris flow methods.pdf</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Freeman, Jonathan P.</author><author>Stohlgren, Thomas J.</author><author>Hunter, Molly E.</author><author>Omi, Philip N.</author><author>Martinson, Erik J.</author><author>Chong, Geneva W.</author><author>Brown, Cynthia S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rapid assessment of postfire plant invasions in coniferous forests of the western United States</title><secondary-title>Ecological Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>1656-1665</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Disturbance</keyword><keyword>Fire effects</keyword><keyword>Fire ecology</keyword><keyword>Canonical correspondence analysis</keyword><keyword>CCA</keyword><keyword>Fuel treatments</keyword><keyword>Fuels reduction</keyword><keyword>Invasion</keyword><keyword>Nonnative species</keyword><keyword>Species diversity</keyword><keyword>Species richness</keyword><keyword>Species-environment relationships</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1051-0761</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1890/06-1859.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fire is a natural part of most forest ecosystems in the western United States, but its effects on nonnative plant invasion have only recently been studied. Also, forest managers are engaging in fuel reduction projects to lessen fire severity, often without considering potential negative ecological consequences such as nonnative plant species introductions. Increased availability of light, nutrients, and bare ground have all been associated with high-severity fires and fuel treatments and are known to aid in the establishment of nonnative plant species. We use vegetation and environmental data collected after wildfires at seven sites in coniferous forests in the western United States to study responses of nonnative plants to wildfire. We compared burned vs. unburned plots and plots treated with mechanical thinning and/or prescribed burning vs. untreated plots for nonnative plant species richness and cover and used correlation analyses to infer the effect of abiotic site conditions on invasibility. Wildfire was responsible for significant increases in nonnative species richness and cover, and a significant decrease in native cover. Mechanical thinning and prescribed fire fuel treatments were associated with significant changes in plant species composition at some sites. Treatment effects across sites were minimal and inconclusive due to significant site and site x treatment interaction effects caused by variation between sites including differences in treatment and fire severities and initial conditions (e.g., nonnative species sources). We used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to determine what combinations of environmental variables best explained patterns of nonnative plant species richness and cover. Variables related to fire severity, soil nutrients, and elevation explained most of the variation in species composition. Nonnative species were generally associated with sites with higher fire severity, elevation, percentage of bare ground, and lower soil nutrient levels and lower canopy cover. Early assessments of postfire stand conditions can guide rapid responses to nonnative plant invasions.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70031012</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kolden, CA</author><author>Weigel, TJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fire risk in San Diego County, California: a weighted Bayesian model approach</title><secondary-title>California Geographer</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>California Geographer</full-title></periodical><pages>42-60</pages><volume>47</volume><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://scholarworks.csun.edu/handle/10211.2/2777</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Syphard, Alexandra D.</author><author>Radeloff, Volker C.</author><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author><author>Hawbaker, Todd J.</author><author>Clayton, Murray K.</author><author>Stewart, Susan I.</author><author>Hammer, Roger B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Human influence on California fire regimes</title><secondary-title>Ecological Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>1388-1402</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire history</keyword><keyword>Fire</keyword><keyword>California, USA</keyword><keyword>Housing density</keyword><keyword>Nonlinear effects</keyword><keyword>Regression</keyword><keyword>Wildland-urban interface</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1051-0761</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1890/06-1128.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Periodic wildfire maintains the integrity and species composition of many ecosystems, including the mediterranean-climate shrublands of California. However, human activities alter natural fire regimes, which can lead to cascading ecological effects. Increased human ignitions at the wildland-urban interface (WUI) have recently gained attention, but fire activity and risk are typically estimated using only biophysical variables. Our goal was to determine how humans influence fire in California and to examine whether this influence was linear, by relating contemporary (2000) and historic (1960-2000) fire data to both human and biophysical variables. Data for the human variables included fine-resolution maps of the WUI produced using housing density and land cover data. Interface WUI, where development abuts wildland vegetation, was differentiated from intermix WUI, where development intermingles with wildland vegetation. Additional explanatory variables included distance to WUI, population density, road density, vegetation type, and ecoregion. All data were summarized at the county level and analyzed using bivariate and multiple regression methods. We found highly significant relationships between humans and fire on the contemporary landscape, and our models explained fire frequency (R2 = 0.72) better than area burned (R2 = 0.50). Population density, intermix WUI, and distance to WUI explained the most variability in fire frequency, suggesting that the spatial pattern of development may be an important variable to consider when estimating fire risk. We found nonlinear effects such that fire frequency and area burned were highest at intermediate levels of human activity, but declined beyond certain thresholds. Human activities also explained change in fire frequency and area burned (1960-2000), but our models had greater explanatory power during the years 1960-1980, when there was more dramatic change in fire frequency. Understanding wildfire as a function of the spatial arrangement of ignitions and fuels on the landscape, in addition to nonlinear relationships, will be important to fire managers and conservation planners because fire risk may be related to specific levels of housing density that can be accounted for in land use planning. With more fires occurring in close proximity to human infrastructure, there may also be devastating ecological impacts if development continues to grow farther into wildland vegetation. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70029709</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ponzetti, J M</author><author>Mccune, B</author><author>Pyke, D A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biotic soil crusts in relation to topography, cheatgrass and fire in the Columbia Basin, Washington</title><secondary-title>Bryologist</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bryologist</full-title></periodical><pages>706-722</pages><volume>110</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>disturbance</keyword><keyword>fire</keyword><keyword>biotic soil crusts</keyword><keyword>canyon-national-park</keyword><keyword>cheatgrass</keyword><keyword>columbia basin</keyword><keyword>community</keyword><keyword>community composition</keyword><keyword>cryptogamic crusts</keyword><keyword>desert</keyword><keyword>erosion</keyword><keyword>microbiotic crusts</keyword><keyword>mosses</keyword><keyword>north-america</keyword><keyword>recovery</keyword><keyword>shrub-steppe</keyword><keyword>soil bryophytes</keyword><keyword>soil lichens</keyword><keyword>washington</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0007-2745</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1639/0007-2745(2007)110[706:BSCIRT]2.0.CO;2</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We studied lichen and bryophyte soil crust communities in a large public grazing allotment within a sagebrush steppe ecosystem in which the biotic soil crusts are largely intact. The allotment had been rested from grazing for 12 years) but experienced an extensive series of wildfires. In the 350, 4 x 0.5 m plots, stratified by topographic position, we found 60 species or species groups that can be distinguished in the field with a hand lens, averaging 11.5 species groups per plot. Lichen and bryophyte soil crust communities differed among topographic positions. Draws were the most disturbed, apparently from water erosion in a narrow channel and mass wasting from the steepened sides. Presumably because of this disturbance, draws had the lowest average species richness of all the topographic strata we examined. Biotic crust species richness and cover were inversely related to cover of the invasive annual, cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), and positively related to cover of native bunchgrasses. Integrity of the biotic crust was more strongly related to cheatgrass than to fire. In general, we observed good recovery of crusts following fire, but only in those areas dominated by perennial bunchgrasses. We interpret the resilience of the biotic crust, in this case, to the low abundance of cheatgrass, low amounts of soil disturbance and high moss cover. These fires have not resulted in an explosion of the cheatgrass population, perhaps because of the historically low levels of livestock grazing.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/1016479</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Faber-Langendoen, D</author><author>Aaseng, N</author><author>Hop, K</author><author>Lew-Smith, M</author><author>Drake, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vegetation classification, mapping, and monitoring at Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota: An application of the U.S. National Vegetation Classification</title><secondary-title>Applied Vegetation Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Applied Vegetation Science</full-title></periodical><pages>361-U70</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>fire</keyword><keyword>accuracy assessment</keyword><keyword>alliance</keyword><keyword>association</keyword><keyword>international vegetation classification</keyword><keyword>legend</keyword><keyword>logging</keyword><keyword>map</keyword><keyword>mapping program</keyword><keyword>national park service vegetation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1402-2001</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1654-109X.2007.tb00435.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Question: How can the U. S. National Vegetation Classification (USNVC) serve as an effective tool for classifying and mapping vegetation, and inform assessments and monitoring? Location: Voyageurs National Park, northern Minnesota, U. S. A and environs. The park contains 54243 ha of terrestrial habitat in the sub-boreal region of North America. Methods: We classified and mapped the natural vegetation using the USNVC, with 'alliance' and 'association' as base units. We compiled 259 classification plots and 1251 accuracy assessment test plots. Both plot and type ordinations were used to analyse vegetation and environmental patterns. Color infrared aerial photography (1: 15840 scale) was used for mapping. Polygons were manually drawn, then transferred into digital form. Classification and mapping products are stored in publicly available databases. Past. re and logging events were used to assess distribution of forest types. Results and Discussion: Ordination and cluster analyses confirmed 49 associations and 42 alliances, with three associations ranked as globally vulnerable to extirpation. Ordination provided a useful summary of vegetation and ecological gradients. Overall map accuracy was 82.4%. Pinus banksiana - Picea mariana forests were less frequent in areas unburned since the 1930s. Conclusion: The USNVC provides a consistent ecological tool for summarizing and mapping vegetation. The products provide a baseline for assessing forests and wetlands, including. re management. The standardized classification and map units provide local to continental perspectives on park resources through linkages to state, provincial, and national classifications in the U. S. and Canada, and to NatureServe's Ecological Systems classification.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cahoon, D R</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Phillips, S W</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Factors affecting coastal wetland loss and restoration</title><secondary-title>Synthesis of U.S. Geological Survey science for the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem and implications for environmental management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Synthesis of U.S. Geological Survey science for the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem and implications for environmental management</full-title></periodical><pages>50-53</pages><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/5211421</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Robichaud, Peter R.</author><author>Lewis, Sarah A.</author><author>Laes, Denise Y.M.</author><author>Hudak, Andrew T.</author><author>Kokaly, Raymond F.</author><author>Zamudio, Joseph A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Postfire soil burn severity mapping with hyperspectral image unmixing</title><secondary-title>Remote Sensing of Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Remote Sensing of Environment</full-title></periodical><pages>467-480</pages><volume>108</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Ash</keyword><keyword>Burn severity</keyword><keyword>Hayman Fire</keyword><keyword>Hyperspectral</keyword><keyword>Mixture tuned matched filter</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0034-4257</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.rse.2006.11.027</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Burn severity is mapped after wildfires to evaluate immediate and long-term fire effects on the landscape. Remotely sensed hyperspectral imagery has the potential to provide important information about fine-scale ground cover components that are indicative of burn severity after large wildland fires. Airborne hyperspectral imagery and ground data were collected after the 2002 Hayman Fire in Colorado to assess the application of high resolution imagery for burn severity mapping and to compare it to standard burn severity mapping methods. Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF), a partial spectral unmixing algorithm, was used to identify the spectral abundance of ash, soil, and scorched and green vegetation in the burned area. The overall performance of the MTMF for predicting the ground cover components was satisfactory (r2= 0.21 to 0.48) based on a comparison to fractional ash, soil, and vegetation cover measured on ground validation plots. The relationship between Landsat-derived differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) values and the ground data was also evaluated (r2= 0.20 to 0.58) and found to be comparable to the MTMF. However, the quantitative information provided by the fine-scale hyperspectral imagery makes it possible to more accurately assess the effects of the fire on the soil surface by identifying discrete ground cover characteristics. These surface effects, especially soil and ash cover and the lack of any remaining vegetative cover, directly relate to potential postfire watershed response processes. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In this research, patterns of burn severity in the Alaskan boreal forest are characterised using 24 fires. First, the relationship between burn severity and area burned is quantified using a linear regression. Second, the spatial correlation of burn severity as a function of topography is modelled using a variogram analysis. Finally, the relationship between vegetation type and spatial patterns of burn severity is quantified using linear models where variograms account for spatial correlation. These results show that: 1) average burn severity increases with the natural logarithm of the area of the wildfire, 2) burn severity is more variable in topographically complex landscapes than in flat landscapes, and 3) there is a significant relationship between burn severity and vegetation type in flat landscapes but not in topographically complex landscapes. These results strengthen the argument that differential flammability of vegetation exists in some boreal landscapes of Alaska. Additionally, these results suggest that through feedbacks between vegetation and burn severity, the distribution of forest vegetation through time is likely more stable in flat terrain than it is in areas with more complex topography.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70030949</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schoenberg, F P</author><author>Chang, C H</author><author>Keeley, J E</author><author>Pompa, J</author><author>Woods, J</author><author>Xu, H Y</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A critical assessment of the Burning Index in Los Angeles County, California</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</full-title></periodical><pages>473-483</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1071/WF05089</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Burning Index (BI) is commonly used as a predictor of wildfire activity. An examination of data on the BI and wildfires in Los Angeles County, California, from January 1976 to December 2000 reveals that although the BI is positively associated with wildfire occurrence, its predictive value is quite limited. Wind speed alone has a higher correlation with burn area than BI, for instance, and a simple alternative point process model using wind speed, relative humidity, precipitation and temperature well outperforms the BI in terms of predictive power. The BI is generally far too high in winter and too low in fall, and may exaggerate the impact of individual variables such as wind speed or temperature during times when other variables, such as precipitation or relative humidity, render the environment ill-suited for wildfires.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70030995</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hartley, Maria K.</author><author>Rogers, William E.</author><author>Siemann, Evan</author><author>Grace, James</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Responses of Prairie Arthropod Communities to Fire and Fertilizer: Balancing Plant and Arthropod Conservation</title><secondary-title>The American Midland Naturalist</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The American Midland Naturalist</full-title></periodical><pages>92-105</pages><volume>157</volume><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0003-0031</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1674/0003-0031(2007)157[92:ROPACT]2.0.CO;2</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fire is an important tool for limiting woody plant invasions into prairies, but using fire management to maintain grassland plant communities may inadvertently reduce arthropod diversity. To test this, we established twenty-four 100 m2 plots in a tallgrass prairie in Galveston County, Texas, in spring 2000. Plots were assigned a fire (no burn, one time burn [2000], two time burn [2000, 2001]) and fertilization treatment (none, NPK addition) in a full factorial design. Fertilization treatments allowed us to examine the effects of fire at a different level of productivity. We measured plant cover by species and sampled arthropods with sweep nets during the 2001 growing season. Path analysis indicated that fertilization reduced while annual fires increased arthropod diversity via increases and decreases in woody plant abundance, respectively. There was no direct effect of fire on arthropod diversity or abundance. Diptera and Homoptera exhibited particularly strong positive responses to fires. Lepidoptera had a negative response to nutrient enrichment. Overall, the negative effects of fire on the arthropod community were minor in contrast to the strong positive indirect effects of small-scale burning on arthropod diversity if conservation of particular taxa is not a priority. The same fire regime that minimized woody plant invasion also maximized arthropod diversity.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032960</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Collins, Brandon M.</author><author>Kelly, Maggi</author><author>Van Wagtendonk, Jan W.</author><author>Stephens, Scott L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spatial patterns of large natural fires in Sierra Nevada wilderness areas</title><secondary-title>Landscape Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Landscape Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>545-557</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire ecology</keyword><keyword>DNBR</keyword><keyword>Normalized Burn Ratio</keyword><keyword>Prescribed natural fire</keyword><keyword>Regression tree</keyword><keyword>Wildland fire use</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0921-2973</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10980-006-9047-5</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The effects of fire on vegetation vary based on the properties and amount of existing biomass (or fuel) in a forest stand, weather conditions, and topography. Identifying controls over the spatial patterning of fire-induced vegetation change, or fire severity, is critical in understanding fire as a landscape scale process. We use gridded estimates of fire severity, derived from Landsat ETM+ imagery, to identify the biotic and abiotic factors contributing to the observed spatial patterns of fire severity in two large natural fires. Regression tree analysis indicates the importance of weather, topography, and vegetation variables in explaining fire severity patterns between the two fires. Relative humidity explained the highest proportion of total sum of squares throughout the Hoover fire (Yosemite National Park, 2001). The lowest fire severity corresponded with increased relative humidity. For the Williams fire (Sequoia/Kings Canyon National Parks, 2003) dominant vegetation type explains the highest proportion of sum of squares. Dominant vegetation was also important in determining fire severity throughout the Hoover fire. In both fires, forest stands that were dominated by lodgepole pine ( Pinus contorta ) burned at highest severity, while red fir ( Abies magnifica ) stands corresponded with the lowest fire severities. There was evidence in both fires that lower wind speed corresponded with higher fire severity, although the highest fire severity in the Williams fire occurred during increased wind speed. Additionally, in the vegetation types that were associated with lower severity, burn severity was lowest when the time since last fire was fewer than 11 and 17 years for the Williams and Hoover fires, respectively. Based on the factors and patterns identified, managers can anticipate the effects of management ignited and naturally ignited fires at the forest stand and the landscape levels.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70029933</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fagre, Daniel B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Adapting to the reality of climate change at Glacier National Park , Montana , USA</title></titles><pages>221-234</pages><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70160343</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Grundel, Ralph</author><author>Pavlovic, Noel B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Distinctiveness , Use , and Value of Midwestern Oak Savannas and Woodlands As Avian Habitats</title><secondary-title>The Auk</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Auk</full-title></periodical><pages>969-985</pages><volume>124</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>fire frequency</keyword><keyword>abiertos de roble del</keyword><keyword>caracteristicas unicas</keyword><keyword>ecotones</keyword><keyword>indicator species</keyword><keyword>land</keyword><keyword>las sabanas y bosques</keyword><keyword>oak savanna</keyword><keyword>oak wood-</keyword><keyword>oeste central como habitats</keyword><keyword>para las aves</keyword><keyword>seasonal effects</keyword><keyword>stopover habitat</keyword><keyword>uso y valor de</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0004-8038</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1642/0004-8038(2007)124[969:DUAVOM]2.0.CO;2</electronic-resource-num><abstract>ABSTRACT.—Oak savannas and woodlands historically covered millions of hect- ares in the midwestern United States but are rare today. We evaluated the ecological distinctiveness and conservation value of savannas and woodlands by examining bird distributions across a fire-maintained woody-vegetation gradient in north- west Indiana encompassing five habitats —open habitats with low canopy cover, savannas, woodlands, scrublands, and forests—during migration, breeding, and overwintering. Savannas and woodlands were significantly different in overall bird species composition from open and forest habitats but were often intermediate between open and forest in guild densities. Few bird species were consistently and highly concentrated in savannas or woodlands, and the Red-headed Woodpecker {Melanerpes erythrocephalus) was the only species significantly more abundant in savannas and woodlands than in open, scrub, and forest habitats. Fire frequency over a 15-year interval was a significant predictor of bird community composition and was positively related to species diversity, spring transient migrant density, and density of the most threatened species. Each habitat type had characteristics poten- tially important for avian conservation. Scrub had the highest density of transient migrants, which suggests it plays an important role as migration stopover habitat. More species were significantly concentrated in open or forest habitats than in the other habitats. Lack of species concentration and intermediate community composi- tion suggested that birds experienced savannas and woodlands more as ecotones than as habitats distinct from forests or grasslands. However, this intermediate character can benefit conservation, as evidenced by savannas and woodlands hav- ing the highest density of the most threatened species along this woody-vegetation gradient.

We monitored the cover of lichens and mosses, cyanobacterial biomass, concentrations of UV-protective pigments in both free-living and lichenized cyanobacteria, and quantum yield in the soil lichen species Collema in an undisturbed Mojave Desert shrubland. During our sampling time, the site received historically high and low levels of precipitation, whereas temperatures were close to normal. Lichen cover, dominated by Collema tenax and C. coccophorum, and moss cover, dominated by Syntrichia caninervis, responded to both increases and decreases in precipitation. This finding for Collema spp. at a hot Mojave Desert site is in contrast to a similar study conducted at a cool desert site on the Colorado Plateau in SE Utah, USA, where Collema spp. cover dropped in response to elevated temperatures, but did not respond to changes in rainfall. The concentrations of UV-protective pigments in free-living cyanobacteria at the Mojave Desert site were also strongly and positively related to rainfall received between sampling times (R2 values ranged from 0.78 to 0.99). However, pigment levels in the lichenized cyanobacteria showed little correlation with rainfall. Quantum yield in Collema spp. was closely correlated with rainfall. Climate models in this region predict a 3.5-4.0 °C rise in temperature and a 15-20% decline in winter precipitation by 2099. Based on our data, this rise in temperature is unlikely to have a strong effect on the dominant species of the soil crusts. However, the predicted drop in precipitation will likely lead to a decrease in soil lichen and moss cover, and high stress or mortality in soil cyanobacteria as levels of UV-protective pigments decline. In addition, surface-disturbing activities (e.g., recreation, military activities, fire) are rapidly increasing in the Mojave Desert, and these disturbances quickly remove soil lichens and mosses. These stresses combined are likely to lead to shifts in species composition and the local extirpation of some lichen or moss species. As these organisms are critical components of nutrient cycling, soil fertility, and soil stability, such changes are likely to reverberate throughout these ecosystems.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70031220</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kokaly, Raymond F.</author><author>Rockwell, Barnaby W.</author><author>Haire, Sandra L.</author><author>King, Trude V.V.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Characterization of post-fire surface cover, soils, and burn severity at the Cerro Grande Fire, New Mexico, using hyperspectral and multispectral remote sensing</title><secondary-title>Remote Sensing of Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Remote Sensing of Environment</full-title></periodical><pages>305-325</pages><volume>106</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire</keyword><keyword>Ash</keyword><keyword>AVIRIS</keyword><keyword>Hyperspectral remote sensing</keyword><keyword>Imaging spectroscopy</keyword><keyword>Landsat</keyword><keyword>Multispectral remote sensing</keyword><keyword>Post-fire</keyword><keyword>Soil mineralogy</keyword><keyword>Surface cover</keyword><keyword>Wildland fire</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0034-4257</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.rse.2006.08.006</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Forest fires leave behind a changed ecosystem with a patchwork of surface cover that includes ash, charred organic matter, soils and soil minerals, and dead, damaged, and living vegetation. The distributions of these materials affect post-fire processes of erosion, nutrient cycling, and vegetation regrowth. We analyzed high spatial resolution (2.4 m pixel size) Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data collected over the Cerro Grande fire, to map post-fire surface cover into 10 classes, including ash, soil minerals, scorched conifer trees, and green vegetation. The Cerro Grande fire occurred near Los Alamos, New Mexico, in May 2000. The AVIRIS data were collected September 3, 2000. The surface cover map revealed complex patterns of ash, iron oxide minerals, and clay minerals in areas of complete combustion. Scorched conifer trees, which retained dry needles heated by the fire but not fully combusted by the flames, were found to cover much of the post-fire landscape. These scorched trees were found in narrow zones at the edges of completely burned areas. A surface cover map was also made using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) data, collected September 5, 2000, and a maximum likelihood, supervised classification. When compared to AVIRIS, the Landsat classification grossly overestimated cover by dry conifer and ash classes and severely underestimated soil and green vegetation cover. In a comparison of AVIRIS surface cover to the Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation (BAER) map of burn severity, the BAER high burn severity areas did not capture the variable patterns of post-fire surface cover by ash, soil, and scorched conifer trees seen in the AVIRIS map. The BAER map, derived from air photos, also did not capture the distribution of scorched trees that were observed in the AVIRIS map. Similarly, the moderate severity class of Landsat-derived burn severity maps generated from the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) calculation had low agreement with the AVIRIS classes of scorched conifer trees. Burn severity and surface cover images were found to contain complementary information, with the dNBR map presenting an image of degree of change caused by fire and the AVIRIS-derived map showing specific surface cover resulting from fire.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70031771</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jacobs, Shayne M</author><author>Bechtold, J S</author><author>Biggs, Harry C</author><author>Grimm, N B</author><author>McClain, M E</author><author>Naiman, R J</author><author>Perakis, Steven S</author><author>Pinay, G</author><author>Scholes, M C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nutrient vectors and riparian nutrient processing in African semiarid savanna ecosystems</title><secondary-title>Ecosystems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecosystems</full-title></periodical><pages>1231--1231-</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>8</issue><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/1016445</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Izbicki, John A.</author><author>Pimentel, Isabel M.</author><author>Johnson, Russell</author><author>Aiken, George R.</author><author>Leenheer, Jerry</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Concentration, UV-spectroscopic characteristics and fractionation of DOC in stormflow from an urban stream, Southern California, USA</title><secondary-title>Environmental Chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>35-48</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1448-2517</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1071/EN06046</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Environmental context. There is concern that there may be public health issues associated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) because of its unknown composition and reactivity to disinfection in water used for public supply. Here, changes in the concentration and composition of DOC in stormflow (1995–2004) in the Santa Ana River and its tributaries is evaluated based on its optical properties, molecular weight and solubility differences of the contributing DOC components. Such a study may allow improved water management in the future. Ongoing work in the study area has shown that DOC in surface water diverted for groundwater recharge degrades to near natural levels in underlying aquifers pumped for public supply. Abstract. The composition of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in stormflow from urban areas has been greatly altered, both directly and indirectly, by human activities and there is concern that there may be public health issues associated with DOC, which has unknown composition from different sources within urban watersheds. This study evaluated changes in the concentration and composition of DOC in stormflow in the Santa Ana River and its tributaries between 1995 and 2004 using a simplified approach based on the differences in the optical properties of DOC and using operationally defined differences in molecular weight and solubility. The data show changes in the composition of DOC in stormflow during the rainy season and differences associated with runoff from different parts of the basin, including extensive upland areas burned prior to the 2004 rainy season. Samples were collected from the Santa Ana River, which drains ~6950 km2 of the densely populated coastal area of southern California, during 23 stormflows between 1995 and 2004. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations during the first stormflows of the ‘winter’ (November to March) rainy season increased rapidly with streamflow and were positively correlated with increased faecal indicator bacteria concentrations. DOC concentrations were not correlated with streamflow or with other constituents during stormflows later in the rainy season and DOC had increasing UV absorbance per unit carbon as the rainy season progressed. DOC concentrations in stormflow from an urban drain tributary to the river also increased during stormflow and were greater than concentrations in the river. DOC concentrations in stormflow from a tributary stream, draining urban and agricultural land that contained more than 320 000 animals, mostly dairy cows, were higher than concentrations in stormflow from the river and from the urban drain. Fires that burned large areas of the basin before the 2004 rainy season did not increase DOC concentrations in the river during stormflow after the fires – possibly because the large watershed of the river damped the effect of the fires. However, the fires increased the hydrophobic neutral organic carbon fraction of DOC in stormflow from the urban drain and the tributary stream.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032826</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>BALDWIN, HEATHER Q.</author><author>GRACE, JAMES B.</author><author>BARROW, WYLIE C.</author><author>ROHWER, FRANK C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Habitat Relationships of Birds Overwintering in a Managed Coastal Prairie</title><secondary-title>The Wilson Journal of Ornithology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Wilson Journal of Ornithology</full-title></periodical><pages>189-197</pages><volume>119</volume><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1676/05-129.1</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1676/05-129.1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hageman, Philip L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>US Geological Survey field leach test for assessing water reactivity and leaching potential of mine wastes, soils, and other geologic and environmental materials</title></titles><pages>14-14</pages><keywords><keyword>environment</keyword><keyword>geologic</keyword><keyword>geological survey</keyword><keyword>geology</keyword><keyword>leaching</keyword><keyword>mine</keyword><keyword>reactivity</keyword><keyword>soil</keyword><keyword>usgs</keyword><keyword>waste</keyword><keyword>water</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>5-D3</isbn><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201300121865</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Taylor, Jonathan G.</author><author>Gillette, Shana C.</author><author>Hodgson, Ronald W.</author><author>Downing, Judith L.</author><author>Burns, Michele R.</author><author>Chavez, Deborah J.</author><author>Hogan, John T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Informing the network: Improving communication with interface communities during wildland fire</title><secondary-title>Human Ecology Review</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Human Ecology Review</full-title></periodical><pages>198-211</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire</keyword><keyword>Communication</keyword><keyword>Quick response research</keyword><keyword>Sense-making</keyword><keyword>Wildland urban interface</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>An interagency research team studied fire communications that took place during different stages of two wildfires in southern California: one small fire of short duration and one large fire of long duration. This "quick- response" research showed that pre-fire communication planning was particularly effective for smaller fire events and parts of that planning proved invaluable for the large fire event as well. Information seeking by the affected public relied on locally convenient sources during the small fire. During the large fire, widespread evacuations disrupted many of the local informal communication networks. Residents' needs were for "real-time, " place-specific information: precise location, severity, size, and direction of spread of the fires. Fire management agencies must contribute real-time, place-specific fire information when it is most needed by the affected public, as they try to make sense out of the chaos of a wildland fire. Disseminating fire information as broadly as possible through multiple pathways will maximize the probability of the public finding the information they need. © Society for Human Ecology.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70031598</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Syphard, Alexandra D.</author><author>Yang, Jian</author><author>Franklin, Janet</author><author>He, Hong S.</author><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Calibrating a forest landscape model to simulate frequent fire in Mediterranean-type shrublands</title><secondary-title>Environmental Modelling and Software</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Modelling and Software</full-title></periodical><pages>1641-1653</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Mediterranean-type ecosystems</keyword><keyword>Calibration</keyword><keyword>Fire regime</keyword><keyword>LANDIS</keyword><keyword>Landscape model</keyword><keyword>Plant functional type</keyword><keyword>Scenario analysis</keyword><keyword>Southern California</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1364-8152</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.envsoft.2007.01.004</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In Mediterranean-type ecosystems (MTEs), fire disturbance influences the distribution of most plant communities, and altered fire regimes may be more important than climate factors in shaping future MTE vegetation dynamics. Models that simulate the high-frequency fire and post-fire response strategies characteristic of these regions will be important tools for evaluating potential landscape change scenarios. However, few existing models have been designed to simulate these properties over long time frames and broad spatial scales. We refined a landscape disturbance and succession (LANDIS) model to operate on an annual time step and to simulate altered fire regimes in a southern California Mediterranean landscape. After developing a comprehensive set of spatial and non-spatial variables and parameters, we calibrated the model to simulate very high fire frequencies and evaluated the simulations under several parameter scenarios representing hypotheses about system dynamics. The goal was to ensure that observed model behavior would simulate the specified fire regime parameters, and that the predictions were reasonable based on current understanding of community dynamics in the region. After calibration, the two dominant plant functional types responded realistically to different fire regime scenarios.

Cadillac Brook watershed burned in a 1947 fire that destroyed vegetation and soil organic matter. We hypothesized that Hg deposition would be higher at Hadlock Brook (the reference watershed, 10.2 microg/m(2)/year) than Cadillac (9.4 microg/m(2)/year) because of the greater scavenging efficiency of the softwood vegetation in Hadlock. We also hypothesized the Hg and DIN export from Cadillac Brook would be lower than Hadlock Brook because of elemental volatilization during the fire, along with subsequently lower rates of atmospheric deposition in a watershed with abundant bare soil and bedrock, and regenerating vegetation. Consistent with these hypotheses, Hg export was lower from Cadillac Brook watershed (0.4 microg/m(2)/year) than from Hadlock Brook watershed (1.3 microg/m(2)/year). DIN export from Cadillac Brook (11.5 eq/ha/year) was lower than Hadlock Brook (92.5 eq/ha/year). These data show that approximately 50 years following a wildfire there was lower atmospheric deposition due to changes in forest species composition, lower soil pools, and greater ecosystem retention for both Hg and DIN.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70033087</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nielsen, Martha G.</author><author>Kahl, Jeffrey S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nutrient export from watersheds on Mt.

Desert Island, Maine, was conducted from January 1999 to September 2000 to determine nutrient export delivery to coastal waters around the island, and to determine whether a series of wildfires in 1947 have affected nutrient export in burned watersheds. Nutrient export (nitrate-nitrogen, total nitrogen, total phosphorus) was determined for each watershed during the study period, and was normalized by watershed area. The yield of nitrate-nitrogen (N) ranged from 10 to 140 kg/km(2)/year. Total N yield ranged from 42 to 250 kg/km(2)/year. Total phosphorus (P) yield ranged from 1.4 to 7.9 kg/km(2)/year. Watersheds entirely within Acadia National Park (lacking human land-based nutrient sources) exported significantly less total N and total P than watersheds that were partly or entirely outside the park boundary. Nitrate-N export was not significantly different in these two groups of watersheds, perhaps because atmospheric deposition is a dominant source of nitrate in the study area. No relation was observed between burn history and nutrient export. Any effect of burn history may be masked by other landscape-level factors related to nutrient export.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032963</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Margolis, Ellis Q.</author><author>Swetnam, Thomas W.</author><author>Allen, Craig D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A stand-replacing fire history in upper montane forests of the southern Rocky Mountains</title><secondary-title>Canadian Journal of Forest Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canadian Journal of Forest Research</full-title></periodical><pages>2227-2241</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>11</issue><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0045-5067</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/X07-079</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Dendroecological techniques were applied to reconstruct stand-replacing fire history in upper montane forests in northern New Mexico and southern Colorado. Fourteen stand-replacing fires were dated to 8 unique fire years (1842– 1901) using four lines of evidence at each of 12 sites within the upper Rio Grande Basin. The four lines of evidence were (i) quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) inner-ring dates, (ii) fire-killed conifer bark-ring dates, (iii) tree-ring width changes or other morphological indicators of injury, and (iv) fire scars. The annual precision of dating allowed the identifi- cation of synchronous stand-replacing fire years among the sites, and co-occurrence with regional surface fire events previ- ously reconstructed from a network of fire scar collections in lower elevation pine forests across the southwestern United States. Nearly all of the synchronous stand-replacing and surface fire years coincided with severe droughts, because cli- mate variability created regional conditions where stand-replacing fires and surface fires burned across ecosystems. Recon- structed stand-replacing fires that predate substantial Anglo-American settlement in this region provide direct evidence that stand-replacing fires were a feature of high-elevation forests before extensive and intensive land-use practices (e.g., log- ging, railroad, and mining) began in the late 19th century.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70031468</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Webb, Robert H</author><author>Griffiths, Peter G</author><author>Wallace, Cynthia S A</author><author>Boyer, Diane E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Channel response to low-elevation desert fire: the King Valley fire of 2005</title></titles><pages>47 p-47 p</pages><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>275</isbn><abstract>In late September to early October 2005, a fire swept north from the Yuma Proving Grounds and into the Kofa National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), traveling mainly along desert wash systems and low-relief alluvial fans. This fire burned 9,975 ha, moving through xeroriparian systems in washes as well as low-elevation desert ecosystems in King Valley, a major area of designated wilderness in the southern part of the Kofa NWR. Using satellite imagery, we determined that 9,255 ha of the Kofa NWR in King Valley burned. The fine-fuel loading for the fire was mostly a native forb (Plantago insularis), and the desert environment that was burned was mostly low-cover creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) scrub with scattered palo verde (Cercidium microphyllum). The wash environments had significant tree cover, including ironwood (Olneya tesota), blue palo verde (Cercidium floridum), desert willow (Chilopsis linearis), and/or smoke tree (Psorothamnus spinosa). This report presents monitoring data collected in June 2006 and January-February 2007 on the effects of this fire on channel morphology in King Valley.</abstract><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ds275</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Grundel, Ralph</author><author>Pavlovic, Noel B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Response of Bird Species Densities to Habitat Structure and Fire History along a Midwestern Open-Forest Gradient</title><secondary-title>The Condor</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Condor</full-title></periodical><pages>734-749</pages><volume>109</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>restoration</keyword><keyword>fire frequency</keyword><keyword>seasonal effects</keyword><keyword>a la estructura del</keyword><keyword>bird density</keyword><keyword>bitat y a la</keyword><keyword>de especies de aves</keyword><keyword>ha</keyword><keyword>historia</keyword><keyword>nonparametric multiplicative regression</keyword><keyword>oak</keyword><keyword>respuestas de las densidades</keyword><keyword>savanna</keyword><keyword>tree density</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0010-5422</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1650/0010-5422(2007)109[734:ROBSDT]2.0.CO;2</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Oak savannas were historically common but are currently rare in the Midwestern United States. We assessed possible associations of bird species with savannas and other threatened habitats in the region by relating fire frequency and vegetation characteristics to seasonal densities of 72 bird species distributed across an open-forest gradient in northwestern Indiana. About one-third of the species did not exhibit statistically significant relationships with any combination of seven vegetation characteristics that included vegetation cover in five vertical strata, dead tree density, and tree height. For 40% of the remaining species, models best predicting species density incorporated tree density. Therefore, management based solely on manipulating tree density may not be an adequate strategy for managing bird populations along this open-forest gradient. Few species exhibited sharp peaks in predicted density under habitat conditions expected in restored savannas, suggesting that few savanna specialists occur among Midwestern bird species. When fire frequency, measured over fifteen years, was added to vegetation characteristics as a predictor of species density, it was incorporated into models for about one-quarter of species, suggesting that fire may modify habitat characteristics in ways that are important for birds but not captured by the structural habitat variables measured. Among those species, similar numbers had peaks in predicted density at low, intermediate, or high fire frequency. For species suggested by previous studies to have a preference for oak savannas along the open-forest gradient, estimated density was maximized at an average fire return interval of about one fire every three years. /// Las sabanas de roble fueron histÃ³ricamente comunes en el Medio Oeste de Estados Unidos pero actualmente son raras en esta regiÃ³n. Evaluamos las posibles asociaciones de especies de aves con sabanas y otros ambientes amenazados en esta regiÃ³n, relacionando la frecuencia de fuego y las caracterÃ­sticas de la vegetaciÃ³n con las densidades estacionales de 72 especies de aves distribuidas a lo largo de un gradiente de bosque abierto en el noroeste de Indiana. Cerca de un tercio de las especies no exhibieron relaciones estadÃ­sticamente significativas con ninguna de las combinaciones de siete caracterÃ­sticas de la vegetaciÃ³n, que incluyeron la cobertura de la vegetaciÃ³n en cinco estratos verticales, la densidad de Ã¡rboles muertos y la altura de los Ã¡rboles. Para el 40% de las especies remanentes, los modelos que mejor predijeron la densidad de especies incorporaron la densidad de Ã³rboles. Por lo tanto, el manejo basado exclusivamente en la manipulatiÃ³n de la densidad de Ã¡rboles no serÃ­a una estrategia adecuada para el manejo de las poblaciones de aves a lo largo de este gradiente de bosque abierto. Pocas especies exhibieron picos marcados en las predicciones de densidad bajo las condiciones de hÃ¡bitat esperadas en las sabanas restauradas, sugiriendo que son pocas las especies de aves especialistas de sabana que existen en el Medio Oeste. La frecuencia de fuego, medida durante mÃ¡s de quince aÃ±os, sumada a las caracterÃ­sticas de la vegetaciÃ³n como variable que predice la densidad de especies, fue incorporada en los modelos para alrededor de un cuarto de las especies. Esto sugiere que el fuego puede modificar caracterÃ­sticas del hÃ¡bitat que son importantes para las aves, pero estas modificaciones no estuvieron reflejadas por las variables de estructura del hÃ¡bitat medidas en este estudio. Entre las especies especialistas de sabana, un nÃºmero similar de especies presentÃ³ picos de densidad predicha a frecuencias de fuego baja, intermedia y alta. SegÃºn estudios anteriores, para las especies que prefieren sabanas de roble a lo largo de un gradiente de bosque abierto, la densidad estimada fue mÃ¡xima a un intervalo promedio de retorno de fuego de aproximadamente un fuego cada tres aÃ±os.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.jstor.org/stable/40072321</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reneau, Steven L.</author><author>Katzman, Danny</author><author>Kuyumjian, Gregory A.</author><author>Lavine, Alexis</author><author>Malmon, Daniel V.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sediment delivery after a wildfire</title><secondary-title>Geology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geology</full-title></periodical><pages>151-154</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>New Mexico</keyword><keyword>Cesium</keyword><keyword>Erosion rates</keyword><keyword>Fires</keyword><keyword>Sediment load</keyword><keyword>Sedimentation rates</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1130/G23288A.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We use a record of sedimentation in a small reservoir within the Cerro Grande burn area, New Mexico, to document postfire delivery of ash, other fine-grained sediment carried in suspension within floods, and coarse-grained sediment transported as bedload over a five-year period. Ash content of sediment layers is estimated using fallout 137Cs as a tracer, and ash concentrations are shown to rapidly decrease through a series of moderate-intensity convective storms in the first rainy season after the fire. Over 90% of the ash was delivered to the reservoir in the first year, and ash concentrations in suspended sediment were negligible after the second year. Delivery of the remainder of the fine sediment also declined rapidly after the first year despite the occurrence of higher-intensity storms in the second year. Fine sediment loads after five years remained significantly above prefire averages. Deposition of coarse-grained sediment was irregular in time and was associated with transport by snowmelt runoff of sediment stored along the upstream channel during short-duration summer floods. Coarse sediment delivery in the first four years was strongly correlated with snowmelt volume, suggesting a transport-limited system with abundant available sediment. Transport rates of coarse sediment declined in the fifth year, consistent with a transition to a more stable channel as the accessible sediment supply was depleted and the channel bed coarsened. Maximum impacts from ash and other fine-grained sediment therefore occurred soon after the fire, whereas the downstream impacts from coarse-grained sediment were attenuated by the more gradual process of bedload sediment transport.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032895</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cannon, Susan H</author><author>Gartner, Joseph E</author><author>Michael, John A</author><author>Bauer, Mark A</author><author>Stitt, Susan C</author><author>Knifong, Donna L</author><author>McNamara, Bernard J</author><author>Roque, Yvonne M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Emergency Assessment of Debris-Flow Hazards from Basins Burned by the 2007 Ammo Fire, San Diego County, Southern California</title></titles><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2007-1413</isbn><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20071413</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Raumann, Christian G</author><author>Soulard, Christopher E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Land-Cover Trends of the Sierra Nevada Ecoregion, 1973-2000</title></titles><pages>34-34</pages><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2007-5011</isbn><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20075011</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dunham, Jason B.</author><author>Rosenberger, Amanda E.</author><author>Luce, Charlie H.</author><author>Rieman, Bruce E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Influences of wildfire and channel reorganization on spatial and temporal variation in stream temperature and the distribution of fish and amphibians</title><secondary-title>Ecosystems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecosystems</full-title></periodical><pages>335-346</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Disturbance</keyword><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Ascaphus montanus</keyword><keyword>Debris flows</keyword><keyword>Oncorhynchus mykiss</keyword><keyword>Solar radiation</keyword><keyword>Stream heating</keyword><keyword>Stream shading</keyword><keyword>Stream temperature</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1432-9840 1435-0629</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10021-007-9029-8</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Wildfire can influence a variety of stream ecosystem properties. We studied stream temperatures in relation to wildfire in small streams in the Boise River Basin, located in central Idaho, USA. To examine the spatio-temporal aspects of temperature in relation to wildfire, we employed three approaches: a pre–post fire comparison of temperatures between two sites (one from a burned stream and one unburned) over 13 years, a shortterm (3 year) pre–post fire comparison of a burned and unburned stream with spatially extensive data, and a short-term (1 year) comparative study of spatial variability in temperatures using a ‘‘space for time‘‘ substitutive design across 90 sites in nine streams (retrospective comparative study). The latter design included streams with a history of stand-replacing wildfire and streams with severe post-fire reorganization of channels due to debris flows and flooding. Results from these three studies indicated that summer maximum water temperatures can remain significantly elevated for at least a decade following wildfire, particularly in streams with severe channel reorganization. In the retrospective comparative study we investigated occurrence of native rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and tailed frog larvae (Ascaphus montanus) in relation to maximum stream temperatures during summer. Both occurred in nearly every site sampled, but tailed frog larvae were found in much warmer water than previously reported in the field (26.6C maximum summer temperature). Our results show that physical stream habitats can remain altered (for example, increased temperature) for many years following wildfire, but that native aquatic vertebrates can be resilient. In a management context, this suggests wildfire may be less of a threat to native species than human influences that alter the capacity of stream-living vertebrates to persist in the face of natural disturbance.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032920</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Eidenshink, Jeff</author><author>Schwind, Brian</author><author>Brewer, Ken</author><author>Zhu, Zhi-Liang</author><author>Quayle, Brad</author><author>Howard, Stephen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Project for Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity</title><secondary-title>Fire Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Fire Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>3-21</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.4996/fireecology.0301003</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Elected officials and leaders of environmental agencies need information about the effects of large wildfires in order to set policy and make management decisions. Recently, the Wildland Fire Leadership Council (WFLC), which implements and coordinates the National Fire Plan (NFP) and Federal Wildland Fire Management Policies (National Fire Plan 2004), adopted a strategy to monitor the effectiveness of the National Fire Plan and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act (HFRA). One component of this strategy is to assess the environmental impacts of large wildland fires and identify the trends of burn severity on all lands across the United States. To that end, WFLC has sponsored a six-year project, Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS), which requires the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service (USDA-FS) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to map and assess the burn severity for all large current and historical fires. Using Landsat data and the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) algorithm, the USGS Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) and USDA-FS Remote Sensing Applications Center will map burn severity of all fires since 1984 greater than 202 ha (500 ac) in the east, and 404 ha (1,000 ac) in the west. The number of historical fires from this period combined with current fires occurring during the course of the project will exceed 9,000. The MTBS project will generate burn severity data, maps, and reports, which will be available for use at local, state, and national levels to evaluate trends in burn severity and help develop and assess the effectiveness of land management decisions. Additionally, the information developed will provide a baseline from which to monitor the recovery and health of fire-affected landscapes over time. Spatial and tabular data quantifying burn severity will augment existing information used to estimate risk associated with a range of current and future resource threats. The annual report of 2004 fires has been completed. All data and results will be distributed to the public on a Web site.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://fireecologyjournal.org/journal/abstract/?abstract=24</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keane, Robert E.</author><author>Key, Carl</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Fagre, Daniel B</author><author>Prato, A</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>CCE fire regimes and their management</title><secondary-title>Sustaining Rocky Mountain Landscapes: Science, Policy, and Management for the Crown of the Continent Ecosystem</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Sustaining Rocky Mountain Landscapes: Science, Policy, and Management for the Crown of the Continent Ecosystem</full-title></periodical><pages>201-212</pages><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Routledge</publisher><isbn>978-1-936331-68-0</isbn><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70160260</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tan, Zhengxi</author><author>Tieszen, Larry L.</author><author>Zhu, Zhiliang</author><author>Liu, Shuguang</author><author>Howard, Stephen M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An estimate of carbon emissions from 2004 wildfires across Alaskan Yukon River Basin</title><secondary-title>Carbon Balance and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Carbon Balance and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>1-8</pages><volume>2</volume><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1750-0680</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1750-0680-2-12</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Wildfires are an increasingly important component of the forces that drive the global carbon (C) cycle and climate change as progressive warming is expected in boreal areas. This study estimated C emissions from the wildfires across the Alaskan Yukon River Basin in 2004. We spatially related the firescars to land cover types and defined the C fractions of aboveground biomass and the ground layer (referring to the top 15 cm organic soil layer only in this paper) consumed in association with land cover types, soil drainage classes, and the C stocks in the ground layer. Results: The fires led to a burned area of 26,500 km2 and resulted in the total C emission of 81.1 ± 13.6 Tg (Tg, Teragram; 1 Tg = 1012 g) or 3.1 ± 0.7 kg C m-2 burned. Of the total C emission, about 73% and 27% could be attributed to the consumption of the ground layer and aboveground biomass, respectively. Conclusion: The predominant contribution of the ground layer to the total C emission implies the importance of ground fuel management to the control of wildfires and mitigation of C emissions. The magnitude of the total C emission depends on fire extent, while the C loss in kg C m-2 burned is affected strongly by the ground layer and soil drainage condition. The significant reduction in the ground layer by large fires may result in profound impacts on boreal ecosystem services with an increase in feedbacks between wildfires and climate change.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70031479</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app

management has focused largely on promoting vegetation homogeneity through uniform distribution of grazing to minimize area in a pasture that is either heavily disturbed or undisturbed. An alternative management model that couples grazing and fire (i.e., patch burning) to promote heterogeneity argues that grazing and fire interact through a series of positive and negative feedbacks to cause a shifting mosaic of vegetation composition and structure across the landscape. We compared patch burning with traditional homogeneity-based management in tallgrass prairie to determine the influence of the two treatments on the aboveground invertebrate community. Patch burning resulted in a temporal flush of invertebrate biomass in patches transitional between unburned and patches burned in the current year. Total invertebrate mass was about 50% greater in these transitional patches within patch-burned pastures as compared to pastures under traditional, homogeneity-based management. Moreover, the mosaic of patches in patch-burned pastures contained a wider range of invertebrate biomass and greater abundance of some invertebrate orders than did the traditionally managed pastures. Patch burning provides habitat that meets requirements for a broad range of invertebrate species, suggesting the potential for patch burning to benefit other native animal assemblages in the food chain.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70033716</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stevens, Michael R</author><author>Bossong, Clifford R</author><author>Litke, David W</author><author>Viger, Roland J</author><author>Rupert, Michael G</author><author>Char, Stephen J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimated Probability of Post-Wildfire Debris-Flow Occurrence and Estimated Volume of Debris Flows from a Pre-Fire Analysis in the Three Lakes Watershed, Grand County, Colorado</title></titles><pages>2008-2008</pages><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>SIM - 3009</isbn><abstract>Debris flows pose substantial threats to life, property, infrastructure, and water resources. Post-wildfire debris flows may be of catastrophic proportions compared to debris flows occurring in unburned areas. During 2006, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with the Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District, initiated a pre-wildfire study to determine the potential for post-wildfire debris flows in the Three Lakes watershed, Grand County, Colorado. The objective was to estimate the probability of post-wildfire debris flows and to estimate the approximate volumes of debris flows from 109 subbasins in the Three Lakes watershed in order to provide the Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District with a relative measure of which subbasins might constitute the most serious debris flow hazards. This report describes the results of the study and provides estimated probabilities of debris-flow occurrence and the estimated volumes of debris flow that could be produced in 109 subbasins of the watershed under an assumed moderate- to high-burn severity of all forested areas. The estimates are needed because the Three Lakes watershed includes communities and substantial water-resources and water-supply infrastructure that are important to residents both east and west of the Continental Divide. Using information provided in this report, land and water-supply managers can consider where to concentrate pre-wildfire planning, pre-wildfire preparedness, and pre-wildfire mitigation in advance of wildfires. Also, in the event of a large wildfire, this information will help managers identify the watersheds with the greatest post-wildfire debris-flow hazards.</abstract><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.usgs.gov/sim/3009/, http://ngmdb.usgs.gov/Prodesc/proddesc_84138.htm</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keigley, Richard B</author><author>Frisina, Michael R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Aspen Height, Stem-girth and Survivorship in an Area of High Ungulate Use</title><secondary-title>Northwest Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Northwest Science</full-title></periodical><pages>199-199</pages><volume>82</volume><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0029-344X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3955/0029-344X-82.3.199</electronic-resource-num><abstract>An increase in ungulate population size potentially exposes aspen suckers, saplings, and trees to increased use. This study examined how stem height and girth influenced the selection of stems by ungulates for browsing, rubbing, and gnawing, and reconstructed the history of ungulate use for the study area. Transects were run through each of three aspen clones growing in southwestern Montana to determine height, circumference, and the surface area from which bark was totally and partially removed by rubbing and gnawing. Stems 20-250 cm tall were browsed. Stems 2-13 cm diameter were preferentially selected for rubbing and gnawing. The area of totally removed bark on dead saplings was twice the area of removed bark on live stems of similar diameter, sug- gesting that bark removal played a major role in the death of some stems. Based on an analysis of stem height and age, ungulate browsing was inferred to have increased from a light-to-moderate level to an intense level in 1991. The depth of scars was used to date scarring events. An increase in rubbing and gnawing was determined to have occurred about 1985. We concluded that elk were primarily responsible for the observed impacts. The combined effect of rubbing, gnawing, and browsing affects a broader span of ages compared to the effect of browsing alone. If prescribed fire is used to rejuvenate aspen stands, the resulting young stems should be protected from heavy browsing, rubbing and gnawing until they reach about 13 cm diameter and have grown out of the browse zone.

Franco) forests of the Pacific Northwest. We studied 24 forest stands with known fire histories in the western Cascade Range in Oregon to evaluate long-term impacts of stand-replacing wildfire on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools and dynamics within the forest floor (FF, Oe and Oa horizons) and the mineral soil (0-10 cm). Twelve of our stands burned approximately 150 years ago ("young''), and the other 12 burned approximately 550 years ago ("old''). Forest floor mean C and N pools were significantly greater in old stands than young stands (N pools: 1823 +/- 132 kg.ha(-1) vs. 1450 +/- 98 kg.ha(-1); C pools: 62 980 +/- 5403 kg.ha(-1) vs. 49 032 +/- 2965 kg.ha(-1), mean +/- SE) as a result of significant differences in FF mass. Forest floor C and N concentrations and C/ N ratios did not differ by time since fire, yet potential N mineralization rates were significantly higher in FF of old sites. Old and young mineral soils did not differ significantly in pools, concentrations, C/ N ratios, or cycling rates. Our results suggest that C and N are sequestered in FF of Pacific Northwest Douglas-fir forests over long (similar to 400 year) intervals, but that shorter fire return intervals may prevent that accumulation.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70000195</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Clark, Perry S</author><author>Scratch, Wendy S</author><author>Bias, Gaylord W</author><author>Stander, Gregory B</author><author>Sexton, Jenne L</author><author>Krawczak, Bridgette J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Preliminary Image Map of the 2007 Witch Fire Perimeter, San Pasqual Quadrangle, San Diego County, California</title></titles><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2008-1069</isbn><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20081069</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Todd, Brian D.</author><author>Rothermel, Betsie B.</author><author>Reed, Robert N.</author><author>Luhring, Thomas M.</author><author>Schlatter, Karen</author><author>Trenkamp, Lester</author><author>Gibbons, J.

In this study, we compared colonization intensity of wood cover boards by S. invicta among four forest man- agement treatments in South Carolina, USA: an unharvested control (&gt;30 years old); a partially thinned stand; a clearcut with coarse woody debris retained; and a clearcut with coarse woody debris removed. Additionally, we compared dehydration rates and survival of recently metamorphosed sala- manders (marbled salamanders, Ambystoma opacum, and mole salamanders, A. talpoideum) among treat- ments. We found that the number of wood cover boards colonized by S. invicta differed significantly among treatments, being lowest in the unharvested forest treatments and increasing with the degree of habitat alteration. Salamanders that were maintained in experimental field enclosures to study water loss were unexpectedly subjected to high levels of S. invicta predation that differed among forest treatments. All known predation by S. invicta was restricted to salamanders in clearcuts. The amount of vegetative ground cover was inversely related to the likelihood of S. invicta predation of salamanders. Our results show that S. invicta abundance increases with habitat disturbance and that this increased abundance has negative consequences for amphibians that remain in altered habitats. Our findings also suggest that the presence of invasive S. invicta may compro- mise the utility of cover boards and other techniques commonly used in herpetological studies in the Southeast.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032191</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Clark, Perry S</author><author>Scratch, Wendy S</author><author>Bias, Gaylord W</author><author>Stander, Gregory B</author><author>Sexton, Jenne L</author><author>Krawczak, Bridgette J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Preliminary Image Map of the 2007 Grass Valley Fire Perimeter, Lake Arrowhead Quadrangle, San Bernardino County, California</title></titles><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2008-1045</isbn><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20081045</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wylie, Bruce Kaile</author><author>Geological Survey (U.S.)</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeling and dynamic monitoring of ecosystem performance in the Yukon River basin</title></titles><keywords><keyword>Biotic communities Yukon River Watershed (Yukon an</keyword><keyword>Ecosystem management Yukon River Watershed (Yukon</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2008-3016</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://purl.access.gpo.gov/GPO/LPS97040</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kolker, Allan</author><author>Engle, Mark A.</author><author>Orem, William H.</author><author>Bunnell, Joseph E.</author><author>Lerch, Harry E.</author><author>Krabbenhoft, David P.</author><author>Olson, Mark L.</author><author>McCord, Jamey D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mercury, trace elements and organic constituents in atmospheric fine particulate matter, Shenandoah National Park, Virginia, USA: A combined approach to sampling and analysis</title><secondary-title>Geostandards and Geoanalytical Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geostandards and Geoanalytical Research</full-title></periodical><pages>279-293</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Mercury</keyword><keyword>Organics</keyword><keyword>PM2.5</keyword><keyword>Shenandoah National Park</keyword><keyword>Trace elements</keyword><keyword>Virginia USA</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1751-908X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1751-908X.2008.00913.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Compliance with U.S. air quality regulatory standards for atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is based on meeting average 24 hour (35 μ m−3) and yearly (15 μg m−3) mass-per-unit-volume limits, regardless of PM2.5 composition. Whereas this presents a workable regulatory framework, information on particle composition is needed to assess the fate and transport of PM2.5 and determine potential environmental/human health impacts. To address these important non-regulatory issues an integrated approach is generally used that includes (1) field sampling of atmospheric particulate matter on filter media, using a size-limiting cyclone, or with no particle-size limitation; and (2) chemical extraction of exposed filters and analysis of separate particulate-bound fractions for total mercury, trace elements and organic constituents, utilising different USGS laboratories optimised for quantitative analysis of these substances. This combination of sampling and analysis allowed for a more detailed interpretation of PM2.5 sources and potential effects, compared to measurements of PM2.5 abundance alone. Results obtained using this combined approach are presented for a 2006 air sampling campaign in Shenandoah National Park (Virginia, USA) to assess sources of atmospheric contaminants and their potential impact on air quality in the Park. PM2.5 was collected at two sampling sites (Big Meadows and Pinnacles) separated by 13.6 km. At both sites, element concentrations in PM25 were low, consistent with remote or rural locations. However, element/Zr crustal abundance enrichment factors greater than 10, indicating anthropogenic input, were found for Hg, Se, S, Sb, Cd, Pb, Mo, Zn and Cu, listed in decreasing order of enrichment. Principal component analysis showed that four element associations accounted for 84% of the PM2.5 trace element variation; these associations are interpreted to represent: (1) crustal sources (Al, REE); (2) coal combustion (Se, Sb), (3) metal production and/or mobile sources (Mo, Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn) and (4) a transient marine source (Sr, Mg). Concentrations of Hg in PM2.5 at background levels in the single pg m−3 were shown by collection and analysis of PM2.5 on filters and by an automated speciation analyser set up at the Big Meadows air quality site. The speciation unit revealed periodic elevation of reactive gaseous mercury (RGM) that co-occurred with peaks in SO2, indicating an anthropogenic source. GC/MS total ion current chromatograms for the two sites were quite similar indicating that organic signatures were regional in extent and/or that the same compounds were present locally at each site. Calculated carbon preference index values for n-alkanes indicated that plant waxes rather than anthropogenic sources, were the dominant alkane source. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were detected, with a predominance of non-alkylated, and higher molecular weight PAHs in this fraction, suggestive of a combustion source (fossil fuel or forest fires). Les normes garantissant la qualité de I'air en ce qui concerne la matière particulaire fine (PM2.5) demandent de respecter des valeurs limites, exprimees en masse par unité de volume, sous forme de moyennes par 24 heures (35 μg m−3) et par an (15 μg m−3), sans considération de composition de ces particules. Ceci présente, certes, une base de régulation utile. Néanmoins il est nécessaire de connaître la composition des PM2.5 pour en préciser le devenir, le mode de transport, et déterminer leur impact potentiel sur I'environnemental et la santé publique. Pour répondre à cette question non prévue dans les normes, nous avons développé une approche intégrée qui combine: (1) un échantillonnage sur le terrain de la matière particulaire atmosphérique, sur des filtres de différents média, en utilisant un cyclone qui avec ou sans coupure selon la taille des particules; (2) une extraction chimique des filtres et I'analyse des concentrations en mercure total, en éléments en trace, et en composés organiques fixés sur ces particules. Ces analyses ont été effectuées dans les différents laboratoires de I'USGS particulièrement adaptés à I'analyse quantitative de ces substances. Cette association d'un échantillonnage spécifique et d'analyses adaptées a permis de proposer des sources possibles des PM2.5 et de préciser leur impact possible, ceci avec des arguments bien meilleurs que ceux fournis par la connaissance de leurs niveaux de concentration seuls. Une campagne de prélèvement a eu lieu en 2006 dans le parc National Shenandoah et les résultats obtenus avec cette approche combinée sont présentés id. Les PM2.5 ont été collectées dans deux sites: Big Meadows et Pinnacles, séparés de 13.6 km. Dans chacun des sites, le niveau de PM2.5 etait bas, typique de sites en milieux isoles ou ruraux. Néanmoins les facteurs d'enrichissement des éléments en trace, qui ont été calculés par normalisation à I'abondance de Zr dans la croûte continentale, montrent des enrichissements notables. Ainsi, les facteurs d'enrichissement des éléments Hg, Se, S, Sb, Cd, Pb, Mo, Zn et Cu, listés par ordre décroissant, se sont révelés être supérieurs à 10. Uanalyse en composantes principales a montré que quatre associations d'éléments rendaient compte de 84% des variations en éléments en trace dans les PM2.5 Ces associations ont été interprétées comme représentant: (1) des sources crustales (Al, REE), (2) la combustion du charbon) (Se, Sb), (3) la métallurgie et/ou les transports (Mo, Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn) et (4) une source marine épisodique (Sr, Mg). Les concentrations en mercure dans les PM2.5 ont des niveaux identiques au bruit de fond, de I'ordre du pg m−3. Elles ont été trouvées dans I'analyse de filtres collectés et confirmées par un analyseur automatique de spéciation installé dans le site de Big Meadows. L'analyseur de spéciation a révélé des augmentations périodiques du mercure gazeux réactif (RGM) associées à des pics de SO2, indiquant pour les deux une source anthropique. Les chromatogrammes obtenus par analyse GC/MS en courant d'ion total, pour les deux sites, étaient très similaires, ce qui démontre que cette signature organique est d'extension régionale et/ou que les mêmes composants étaient présents dans les deux sites. Les valeurs calculées d'index de carbone optimal pour les alcanes-n, indiquent que la source d'alcanes dominante provient de produits cireux d'origine végétale plutôt qu'anthropogénique. Des hydrocarbures polycycliques aromatiques (PAHs) ont été détectes, avec une prédominance de PAHs non alkyles de poids moléculaire élevé, dont la source pourrait être la combustion de fuel fossile ou des feux de forêt.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70030236</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gartner, Joseph E.</author><author>Cannon, Susan H.</author><author>Santi, Paul M.</author><author>Dewolfe, Victor G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Empirical models to predict the volumes of debris flows generated by recently burned basins in the western U.S.</title><secondary-title>Geomorphology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geomorphology</full-title></periodical><pages>339-354</pages><volume>96</volume><issue>3-4</issue><keywords><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Debris flow</keyword><keyword>Hazard assessment</keyword><keyword>Multiple regression</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0169-555X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.geomorph.2007.02.033</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Recently burned basins frequently produce debris flows in response to moderate-to-severe rainfall. Post-fire hazard assessments of debris flows are most useful when they predict the volume of material that may flow out of a burned basin. This study develops a set of empirically-based models that predict potential volumes of wildfire-related debris flows in different regions and geologic settings. The models were developed using data from 53 recently burned basins in Colorado, Utah and California. The volumes of debris flows in these basins were determined by either measuring the volume of material eroded from the channels, or by estimating the amount of material removed from debris retention basins. For each basin, independent variables thought to affect the volume of the debris flow were determined. These variables include measures of basin morphology, basin areas burned at different severities, soil material properties, rock type, and rainfall amounts and intensities for storms triggering debris flows. Using these data, multiple regression analyses were used to create separate predictive models for volumes of debris flows generated by burned basins in six separate regions or settings, including the western U.S., southern California, the Rocky Mountain region, and basins underlain by sedimentary, metamorphic and granitic rocks. An evaluation of these models indicated that the best model (the Western U.S. model) explains 83% of the variability in the volumes of the debris flows, and includes variables that describe the basin area with slopes greater than or equal to 30%, the basin area burned at moderate and high severity, and total storm rainfall. This model was independently validated by comparing volumes of debris flows reported in the literature, to volumes estimated using the model. Eighty-seven percent of the reported volumes were within two residual standard errors of the volumes predicted using the model. This model is an improvement over previous models in that it includes a measure of burn severity and an estimate of modeling errors. The application of this model, in conjunction with models for the probability of debris flows, will enable more complete and rapid assessments of debris flow hazards following wildfire.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032130</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keane, Robert E.</author><author>Agee, James K.</author><author>Fuĺ, Peter</author><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author><author>Key, Carl</author><author>Kitchen, Stanley G.</author><author>Miller, Richard</author><author>Schulte, Lisa A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ecological effects of large fires on US landscapes: Benefit or catastrophe?</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</full-title></periodical><pages>696-712</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire effects</keyword><keyword>Fire regimes</keyword><keyword>Megafires</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1049-8001</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1071/WF07148</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The perception is that today’s large fires are an ecological catastrophe because they burn vast areas with high intensities and severities. However, little is known of the ecological impacts of large fires on both historical and contemporary landscapes. The present paper presents a review of the current knowledge of the effects of large fires in the United States by important ecosystems written by regional experts. The ecosystems are (1) ponderosa pine–Douglas-fir, (2) sagebrush–grasslands, (3) piñon–juniper, (4) chaparral, (5) mixed-conifer, and (6) spruce–fir. This review found that large fires were common on most historical western US landscapes and they will continue to be common today with exceptions. Sagebrush ecosystems are currently experiencing larger, more severe, and more frequent large fires compared to historical conditions due to exotic cheatgrass invasions. Historical large fires in south-west ponderosa pine forest created a mixed severity mosaic dominated by non-lethal surface fires while today’s large fires are mostly high severity crown fires. While large fires play an important role in landscape ecology for most regions, their importance is much less in the dry piñon–juniper forests and sagebrush–grasslands. Fire management must address the role of large fires in maintaining the health of many US fire-dominated ecosystems.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70179554</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lundstrom, S.

Studies using both proxies have become more common in regions where lakes are present and fire frequencies are low, but are rare where high-frequency surface fires dominate and sedimentary deposits are primarily bogs and wetlands. Here we investigate sedimentary and fire-scar records of fire in two small watersheds in northern New Mexico, in settings recently characterised by relatively high-frequency fire where bogs and wetlands (Chihuahue os Bog and Alamo Bog) are more common than lakes. Our research demonstrates that: (1) essential features of the sedimentary charcoal record can be reproduced between multiple cores within a bog deposit; (2) evidence from both fire-scarred trees and charcoal deposits documents an anomalous lack of fire since similar to 1900, compared with the remainder of the Holocene; (3) sedimentary charcoal records probably underestimate the recurrence of fire events at these high-frequency fire sites; and (4) the sedimentary records from these bogs are complicated by factors such as burning and oxidation of these organic deposits, diversity of vegetation patterns within watersheds, and potential bioturbation by ungulates. We consider a suite of particular challenges in developing and interpreting fire histories from bog and wetland settings in the Southwest. The identification of these issues and constraints with interpretation of sedimentary charcoal fire records does not diminish their essential utility in assessing millennial-scale patterns of fire activity in this dry part of North America</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032032</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mast, M.

Burned and unburned drainages were monitored from December 2003 through August 2007 for streamflow, major constituents, nutrients, and suspended sediment following the fires. Stream-water nitrate concentrations showed the greatest response to fire, increasing up to tenfold above those in the unburned drainage just prior to the first post-fire snowmelt season. Concentrations in winter base flow remained elevated during the entire study period, whereas concentrations during the growing season returned to background levels after two snowmelt seasons. Annual export of total nitrogen from the burned drainage ranged from 1Ð53 to 3Ð23 kg ha?1 yr?1 compared with 1Ð01 to 1Ð39 kg ha?1 yr?1 from the unburned drainage and exceeded atmospheric inputs for the first two post-fire water years. Fire appeared to have minimal long-term effects on other nutrients, dissolved organic carbon, and major constituents with the exception of sulfate and chloride, which showed increased concentrations for 2 years following the fire. There was little evidence that fire affected suspended-sediment concentrations in the burned drainage. Sediment yields in subalpine streams may be less affected by fire than in lower elevation streams because of the slow release rate of water during spring snowmelt</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70179821</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>White, Joseph D.</author><author>Gutzwiller, Kevin J.</author><author>Barrow, Wylie C.</author><author>Randall, Lori Johnson</author><author>Swint, Pamela</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeling mechanisms of vegetation change due to fire in a semi-arid ecosystem</title><secondary-title>Ecological Modelling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Modelling</full-title></periodical><pages>181-200</pages><volume>214</volume><issue>2-4</issue><keywords><keyword>Climate change</keyword><keyword>Disturbance</keyword><keyword>Fire</keyword><keyword>Big Bend National Park</keyword><keyword>Modeling</keyword><keyword>Physiological processes</keyword><keyword>SEM-LAND model</keyword><keyword>Semi-arid</keyword><keyword>Shrub encroachment</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0304-3800</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2008.02.032</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Vegetation growth and community composition in semi-arid environments is determined by water availability and carbon assimilation mechanisms specific to different plant types. Disturbance also impacts vegetation productivity and composition dependent on area affected, intensity, and frequency factors. In this study, a new spatially explicit ecosystem model is presented for the purpose of simulating vegetation cover type changes associated with fire disturbance in the northern Chihuahuan Desert region. The model is called the Landscape and Fire Simulator (LAFS) and represents physiological activity of six functional plant types incorporating site climate, fire, and seed dispersal routines for individual grid cells. We applied this model for Big Bend National Park, Texas, by assessing the impact of wildfire on the trajectory of vegetation communities over time. The model was initialized and calibrated based on landcover maps derived from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper data acquired in 1986 and 1999 coupled with plant biomass measurements collected in the field during 2000. Initial vegetation cover change analysis from satellite data showed shrub encroachment during this time period that was captured in the simulated results. A synthetic 50-year climate record was derived from historical meteorological data to assess system response based on initial landcover conditions. This simulation showed that shrublands increased to the detriment of grass and yucca-ocotillo vegetation cover types indicating an ecosystem-level trajectory for shrub encroachment. Our analysis of simulated fires also showed that fires significantly reduced site biomass components including leaf area, stem, and seed biomass in this semi-arid ecosystem. In contrast to other landscape simulation models, this new model incorporates detailed physiological responses of functional plant types that will allow us to simulated the impact of increased atmospheric CO2 occurring with climate change coupled with fire disturbance. Simulations generated from this model are expected to be the subject of subsequent studies on landscape dynamics with specific regard to prediction of wildlife distributions associated with fire management and climate change.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032804</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Roberts, Susan L</author><author>Van Wagtendonk, Jan W</author><author>Miles, A Keith</author><author>Kelt, Douglas A</author><author>Lutz, James A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeling the Effects of Fire Severity and Spatial Complexity on Small Mammals in Yosemite National Park, California</title><secondary-title>Fire ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Fire ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>83-104</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>abundance</keyword><keyword>brush mice</keyword><keyword>california ground squirrel</keyword><keyword>chipmunks</keyword><keyword>deer mice</keyword><keyword>habitat</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.4996/fireecology.0402083</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We evaluated the impact of fire severity and related spatial and vegetative parameters on small mammal populations in 2 yr- to 15 yr-old burns in Yosemite National Park, California, USA.

Among disjunct populations of conspecific trees, alternative distributions are also possible and may be attributed to more localized variation in disturbance. Regional differences in structure and demography among disjunct populations of sand pine (Pinus clausa (Chapm. ex Engelm.) Vasey ex Sarg.) in the Florida panhandle and peninsula may result from variation in hurricane regimes associated with each of these populations. We measured size, age, and growth rates of trees from panhandle and peninsula populations and then compiled size and age class distributions. We also characterized hurricanes in both regions over the past century. Size and age structures of panhandle populations were unevenly distributed and exhibited continuous recruitment; peninsula populations were evenly sized and aged and exhibited only periodic recruitment. Since hurricane regimes were similar between regions, historical fire regimes may have been responsible for regional differences in structure of sand pine populations. We hypothesize that fires were locally nonexistent in coastal panhandle populations, while periodic high intensity fires occurred in peninsula populations over the past century. Such differences in local fire regimes could have resulted in the absence of hurricane effects in the peninsula. Increased intensity of hurricanes in the panhandle and current fire suppression patterns in the peninsula may shift characteristics of sand pine stands in both regions.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032154</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kinner, D a</author><author>Moody, J a</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Infiltration and runoff measurements on steep burned hillslopes using a rainfall simulator with variable rain intensities.</title></titles><pages>64-64</pages><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>SIR - 2007-5211</isbn><abstract>Multiple rainfall intensities were used in rainfall-simulation experiments designed to investigate the infiltration and runoff from 1-square-meter plots on burned hillslopes covered by an ash layer of varying thickness. The 1-square-meter plots were on north- and south-facing hillslopes in an area burned by the Overland fire northwest of Boulder near Jamestown on the Front Range of Colorado. A single-nozzle, wide-angle, multi-intensity rain simulator was developed to investigate the infiltration and runoff on steep (30- to 40-percent gradient) burned hillslopes covered with ash. The simulated rainfall was evaluated for spatial variability, drop size, and kinetic energy. Fourteen rainfall simulations, at three intensities (about 20 millimeters per hour [mm/h], 35 mm/h, and 50 mm/h), were conducted on four plots. Measurements during and after the simulations included runoff, rainfall, suspended-sediment concentrations, surface ash layer thickness, soil moisture, soil grain size, soil lost on ignition, and plot topography. Runoff discharge reached a steady state within 7 to 26 minutes. Steady infiltration rates with the 50-mm/h application rainfall intensity approached 20–35 mm/h. If these rates are projected to rainfall application intensities used in many studies of burned area runoff production (about 80 mm/h), the steady discharge rates are on the lower end of measurements from other studies. Experiments using multiple rainfall intensities (three) suggest that runoff begins at rainfall intensities around 20 mm/h at the 1-square-meter scale, an observation consistent with a 10-mm/h rainfall intensity threshold needed for runoff initiation that has been reported in the literature</abstract><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20075211</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rupert, Michael G.; Cannon</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using Logistic Regression to Predict the Probability of Debris Flows in Areas Burned by Wildfires, Southern California, 2003-2006</title></titles><pages>iv, 9 p.-iv, 9 p.</pages><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2008-1370</isbn><abstract>Logistic regression was used to develop statistical models that can be used to predict the probability of debris flows in areas recently burned by wildfires by using data from 14 wildfires that burned in southern California during 2003-2006. Twenty-eight independent variables describing the basin morphology, burn severity, rainfall, and soil properties of 306 drainage basins located within those burned areas were evaluated. The models were developed as follows: (1) Basins that did and did not produce debris flows soon after the 2003 to 2006 fires were delineated from data in the National Elevation Dataset using a geographic information system; (2) Data describing the basin morphology, burn severity, rainfall, and soil properties were compiled for each basin. These data were then input to a statistics software package for analysis using logistic regression; and (3) Relations between the occurrence or absence of debris flows and the basin morphology, burn severity, rainfall, and soil properties were evaluated, and five multivariate logistic regression models were constructed. All possible combinations of independent variables were evaluated to determine which combinations produced the most effective models, and the multivariate models that best predicted the occurrence of debris flows were identified. Percentage of high burn severity and 3-hour peak rainfall intensity were significant variables in all models. Soil organic matter content and soil clay content were significant variables in all models except Model 5. Soil slope was a significant variable in all models except Model 4. The most suitable model can be selected from these five models on the basis of the availability of independent variables in the particular area of interest and field checking of probability maps. The multivariate logistic regression models can be entered into a geographic information system, and maps showing the probability of debris flows can be constructed in recently burned areas of southern California. This study demonstrates that logistic regression is a valuable tool for developing models that predict the probability of debris flows occurring in recently burned landscapes.</abstract><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2008/1370/</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>deWolfe, Victor G.</author><author>Santi, Paul M.</author><author>Ey, J.</author><author>Gartner, Joseph E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effective mitigation of debris flows at Lemon Dam, La Plata County, Colorado</title><secondary-title>Geomorphology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geomorphology</full-title></periodical><pages>366-377</pages><volume>96</volume><issue>3-4</issue><keywords><keyword>Seeding</keyword><keyword>Erosion</keyword><keyword>Debris flow</keyword><keyword>Mitigation</keyword><keyword>Mulch</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.geomorph.2007.04.008</electronic-resource-num><abstract>To reduce the hazards from debris flows in drainage basins burned by wildfire, erosion control measures such as construction of check dams, installation of log erosion barriers (LEBs), and spreading of straw mulch and seed are common practice. After the 2002 Missionary Ridge Fire in southwest Colorado, these measures were implemented at Knight Canyon above Lemon Dam to protect the intake structures of the dam from being filled with sediment. Hillslope erosion protection measures included LEBs at concentrations of 220-620/ha (200-600% of typical densities), straw mulch was hand spread at concentrations up to 5.6??metric tons/hectare (125% of typical densities), and seeds were hand spread at 67-84??kg/ha (150% of typical values). The mulch was carefully crimped into the soil to keep it in place. In addition, 13 check dams and 3 debris racks were installed in the main drainage channel of the basin. The technical literature shows that each mitigation method working alone, or improperly constructed or applied, was inconsistent in its ability to reduce erosion and sedimentation. At Lemon Dam, however, these methods were effective in virtually eliminating sedimentation into the reservoir, which can be attributed to a number of factors: the density of application of each mitigation method, the enhancement of methods working in concert, the quality of installation, and rehabilitation of mitigation features to extend their useful life. The check dams effectively trapped the sediment mobilized during rainstorms, and only a few cubic meters of debris traveled downchannel, where it was intercepted by debris racks. Using a debris volume-prediction model developed for use in burned basins in the Western U.S., recorded rainfall events following the Missionary Ridge Fire should have produced a debris flow of approximately 10,000??m3 at Knight Canyon. The mitigation measures, therefore, reduced the debris volume by several orders of magnitude. For comparison, rainstorm-induced debris flows occurred in two adjacent canyons at volumes within the range predicted by the model. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In boreal black spruce (Picea mariana) forests near Delta Junction, Alaska, we quantified aboveground plant biomass and net primary productivity (ANPP) for 4 years after a 1999 wildfire in a well-drained (dry) site, and also across a dry and a moderately well-drained (mesic) chronosequence of sites that varied in time since fire (2 to $116 years). Four years after fire, total biomass at the 1999 burn site had increased exponentially to 160 ± 21 g m)2 (mean ± 1SE) and vascular ANPP had recovered to 138 ± 32 g m)2 y)1 , which was not different than that of a nearby unburned stand (160 ± 48 g m)2 y)1) that had similar pre-fire stand structure and understory composition. Production in the young site was dominated by re-sprouting graminoids, whereas production in the unburned site was dominated by black spruce. On the dry and mesic chrono-sequences, total biomass pools, including over-story and understory vascular and non-vascular plants, and lichens, increased logarithmically (dry) or linearly (mesic) with increasing site age, reaching a maximum of 2469 ± 180 (dry) and 4008 ± 233 g m)2 (mesic) in mature stands. Bio-mass differences were primarily due to higher tree density in the mesic sites because mass per tree was similar between sites. ANPP of vascular and non-vascular plants increased linearly over time in the mesic chronosequence to 335 ± 68 g m)2 y)1 in the mature site, but in the dry chronosequence it peaked at 410 ± 43 g m)2 y)1 in a 15-year-old stand dominated by deciduous trees and shrubs. Key factors regulat-ing biomass accumulation and production in these ecosystems appear to be the abundance and composition of re-sprouting species early in suc-cession, the abundance of deciduous trees and shrubs in intermediate aged stands, and the density of black spruce across all stand ages. A better understanding of the controls over these factors will help predict how changes in climate and fire regime will affect the carbon balance of Interior Alaska.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70033661</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Anderson, R.

Sedimentary records from lakes and bogs in the southern Rocky Mountains of Colorado and New Mexico provide information on the relationships between climate and vegetation change, and fire history since deglaciation. We present a new pollen record from Hunters Lake (Colorado) as an example of a high-elevation vegetation history from the southern Rockies. We then present a series of six sedimentary records from similar to 2600 to 3500-m elevation, including sites presently at the alpine-subalpine boundary, within the Picea engelmannii-Abies lasiocarpa forest and within the mixed conifer forest, to determine the history of fire in high-elevation forests there. High Artemisia and low but increasing percentages of Picea and Pinus suggest vegetation prior to 13 500 calendar years before present (cal yr BP) was tundra or steppe, with open spruce woodland to similar to 11 900 cal yr BP. Subalpine forest (Picea engelmannii, Abies lasiocarpa) existed around the lake for the remainder of the Holocene. At lower elevations, Pinus ponderosa and/or contorta expanded 11 900 to 10 200 cal yr BP; mixed conifer forest expanded similar to 8600 to 4700 cal yr BP; and Pinus edulis expanded after similar to 4700 cal yr BP. Sediments from lake sites near the alpine-subalpine transition contained five times less charcoal than those entirely within subalpine forests, and 40 times less than bog sites within mixed conifer forest. Higher fire episode frequencies occurred between similar to 12 000 and 9000 cal yr BP (associated with the initiation or expansion of south-west monsoon and abundant lightning, and significant biomass during vegetation turnover) and at similar to 2000-1000 cal yr BP (related to periodic droughts during the long-term trend towards wetter conditions and greater biomass). Fire episode frequencies for subalpine-alpine transition and subalpine sites were on average 5 to 10 fire events/1000 years over the Holocene, corresponding to one fire event every similar to 100 to 200 years. (5) Our Holocene-length sedimentary charcoal records provide additional evidence for the anomalous nature of the 20th-century fire regime, where fires were largely suppressed as a national policy.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70033602</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bartlein, P.

The mapped distributions of all lightning- and human-started fires during the 11-year interval show similar first-order patterns that reflect the broad-scale distribution of vegetation across the West and the annual cycle of climate. Lightning-started fires are concentrated in the summer half-year and occur in widespread outbreaks that last a few days and reflect coherent weather-related controls. In contrast, fires started by humans occur throughout the year and tend to be concentrated in regions surrounding large-population centres or intensive-agricultural areas. Although the primary controls of human-started fires are their location relative to burnable fuel and the level of human activity, spatially coherent, weather-related variations in their incidence can also be noted.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70033601</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cannon, Susan H.</author><author>Gartner, Joseph E.</author><author>Wilson, Raymond C.</author><author>Bowers, James C.</author><author>Laber, Jayme L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Storm rainfall conditions for floods and debris flows from recently burned areas in southwestern Colorado and southern California</title><secondary-title>Geomorphology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geomorphology</full-title></periodical><pages>250-269</pages><volume>96</volume><issue>3-4</issue><keywords><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Debris flow</keyword><keyword>Rainfall intensity-duration thresholds</keyword><keyword>Warning systems</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0169-555X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.geomorph.2007.03.019</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Debris flows generated during rain storms on recently burned areas have destroyed lives and property throughout the Western U.S. Field evidence indicate that unlike landslide-triggered debris flows, these events have no identifiable initiation source and can occur with little or no antecedent moisture. Using rain gage and response data from five fires in Colorado and southern California, we document the rainfall conditions that have triggered post-fire debris flows and develop empirical rainfall intensity-duration thresholds for the occurrence of debris flows and floods following wildfires in these settings. This information can provide guidance for warning systems and planning for emergency response in similar settings. Debris flows were produced from 25 recently burned basins in Colorado in response to 13 short-duration, high-intensity convective storms. Debris flows were triggered after as little as six to 10 min of storm rainfall. About 80% of the storms that generated debris flows lasted less than 3 h, with most of the rain falling in less than 1 h. The storms triggering debris flows ranged in average intensity between 1.0 and 32.0 mm/h, and had recurrence intervals of two years or less. Threshold rainfall conditions for floods and debris flows sufficiently large to pose threats to life and property from recently burned areas in south-central, and southwestern, Colorado are defined by: I = 6.5D- 0.7 and I = 9.5D- 0.7, respectively, where I = rainfall intensity (in mm/h) and D = duration (in hours). Debris flows were generated from 68 recently burned areas in southern California in response to long-duration frontal storms. The flows occurred after as little as two hours, and up to 16 h, of low-intensity (2-10 mm/h) rainfall. The storms lasted between 5.5 and 33 h, with average intensities between 1.3 and 20.4 mm/h, and had recurrence intervals of two years or less. Threshold rainfall conditions for life- and property-threatening floods and debris flows during the first winter season following fires in Ventura County, and in the San Bernardino, San Gabriel and San Jacinto Mountains of southern California are defined by I = 12.5D-0.4, and I = 7.2D-0.4, respectively. A threshold defined for flood and debris-flow conditions following a year of vegetative recovery and sediment removal for the San Bernardino, San Gabriel and San Jacinto Mountains of I = 14.0D-0.5 is approximately 25 mm/h higher than that developed for the first year following fires. The thresholds defined here are significantly lower than most identified for unburned settings, perhaps because of the difference between extremely rapid, runoff-dominated processes acting in burned areas and longer-term, infiltration-dominated processes on unburned hillslopes.

Consequences of landscape change, both from development and forest management practices including fire suppression, have prompted rising levels of concern for the ecological integrity of the region. The impacts from these activities include decreased water quality, degraded biotic communities, and increased fire hazard. To establish an understanding of the Lake Tahoe basin's landscape change in the context of forest management and development we mapped, quantified, and described the spatial and temporal distribution and variability of historical changes in land use and land cover in the southern Lake Tahoe basin (279 km2) from 1940 to 2002. Our assessment relied on post-classification change detection of multi-temporal land-use/cover and impervious-surface-area data that were derived through manual interpretation, image processing, and GIS data integration for four dates of imagery: 1940, 1969, 1987, and 2002. The most significant land conversion during the 62-year study period was an increase in developed lands with a corresponding decrease in forests, wetlands, and shrublands. Forest stand densities increased throughout the 62-year study period, and modern thinning efforts resulted in localized stand density decreases in the latter part of the study period. Additionally forests were gained from succession, and towards the end of the study period extensive tree mortality occurred. The highest rates of change occurred between 1940 and 1969, corresponding with dramatic development, then rates declined through 2002 for all observed landscape changes except forest density decrease and tree mortality. Causes of landscape change included regional population growth, tourism demands, timber harvest for local use, fire suppression, bark beetle attack, and fuels reduction activities. Results from this study offer land managers within the Lake Tahoe basin and in similar regions a basis for making better informed land-use and management decisions to potentially minimize detrimental ecological impacts of landscape change. The perspective to be gained is based on quantitative retrospection of the effects of human-driven changes and the impacts of management action or inaction to the forested landscape. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, their spatial effects have not been evaluated. Our goal was to model the human footprint across the western United States. We first delineated the actual area occupied by anthropogenic features, the physical effect area. Next, we developed the human footprint model based on the ecological effect area, the zone influenced by features beyond their physical presence, by combining seven input models: three models quantified top-down anthropogenic influences of synanthropic predators (avian predators, domestic dog and cat presence risk), and four models quantified bottom-up anthropogenic influences on habitat (invasion of exotic plants, human-caused fires, energy extraction, and anthropogenic wildland fragmentation). Using independent bird population data, we found bird abundance of four synanthropic species to correlate positively with human footprint intensity and negatively for three of the six species influenced by habitat fragmentation. We then evaluated the extent of the human footprint in relation to terrestrial (ecoregions) and aquatic systems (major rivers and lakes), regional management and conservation status, physical environment, and temporal changes in human actions. The physical effect area of anthropogenic features covered 13% of the western United States with agricultural land (9.8%) being most dominant. High-intensity human footprint areas (class 8-10) overlapped highly productive low-elevation private landholdings and covered 7% of the western United States compared to 48% for low-intensity areas (class 1-3), which were confined to low-productivity high-elevation federal landholdings. Areas within 1 km of rivers were more affected by the human footprint compared to lakes. Percentage human population growth was higher in low-intensity human footprint areas. The disproportional regional effects of the human footprint on landscapes in the western United States create a challenge to management of ecosystems and wildlife populations. Using footprint models, managers can plan land use actions, develop restoration scenarios, and identify areas of high conservation value at local landscapes within a regional context. Moreover, human footprint models serve as a tool to stratify landscapes for studies investigating floral and faunal response to human disturbance intensity gradients.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70033547</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Webb, Robert H.</author><author>Magirl, Christopher S.</author><author>Griffiths, Peter G.</author><author>Boyer, Diane E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Debris Flows and Floods in Southeastern Arizona from Extreme Precipitation in July 2006 - Magnitude, Frequency, and Sediment Delivery</title></titles><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2008-1274</isbn><abstract>Place of publication varies.</abstract><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20081274</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moody, John A.</author><author>Martin, Deborah A.</author><author>Haire, Sandra L.</author><author>Kinner, David A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Linking runoff response to burn severity after a wildfire</title><secondary-title>Hydrological Processes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hydrological Processes</full-title></periodical><pages>2063-2074</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>13</issue><keywords><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Burn severity</keyword><keyword>Connectivity</keyword><keyword>Peak discharge</keyword><keyword>Runoff response</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1099-1085</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/hyp.6806</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Abstract 10.1002/hyp.6806.abs Extreme floods often follow wildfire in mountainous watersheds. However, a quantitative relation between the runoff response and burn severity at the watershed scale has not been established. Runoff response was measured as the runoff coefficient C, which is equal to the peak discharge per unit drainage area divided by the average maximum 30 min rainfall intensity during each rain storm. The magnitude of the burn severity was expressed as the change in the normalized burn ratio. A new burn severity variable, hydraulic functional connectivity Φ was developed and incorporates both the magnitude of the burn severity and the spatial sequence of the burn severity along hillslope flow paths. The runoff response and the burn severity were measured in seven subwatersheds (0·24 to 0·85 km2) in the upper part of Rendija Canyon burned by the 2000 Cerro Grande Fire near Los Alamos, New Mexico, USA. A rainfall–discharge relation was determined for four of the subwatersheds with nearly the same burn severity. The peak discharge per unit drainage area $Q_{\rm u}^{\rm peak}$ was a linear function of the maximum 30 min rainfall intensity I30. This function predicted a rainfall intensity threshold of 8·5 mm h−1 below which no runoff was generated. The runoff coefficient $C = Q_{\rm u}^{\rm peak}/I_{30}$ was a linear function of the mean hydraulic functional connectivity of the subwatersheds. Moreover, the variability of the mean hydraulic functional connectivity was related to the variability of the mean runoff coefficient, and this relation provides physical insight into why the runoff response from the same subwatershed can vary for different rainstorms with the same rainfall intensity.

We develop a technique to monitor ecological changes in a way that distinguishes climate influences from disturbances. In this study, we account for climatic influences on Alaskan boreal forest performance with a data-driven model. We defined ecosystem performance anomalies (EPA) using the residuals of the model and made annual maps of EPA. Most areas (88%) did not have anomalous ecosystem performance for at least 6 of 8 years between 1996 and 2004. Areas with underperforming EPA (10%) often indicate areas associated with recent fires and areas of possible insect infestation or drying soil related to permafrost degradation. Overperforming areas (2%) occurred in older fire recovery areas where increased deciduous vegetation components are expected. The EPA measure was validated with composite burn index data and Landsat vegetation indices near and within burned areas.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70159449</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mendelsohn, Mark B</author><author>Brehme, Cheryl S</author><author>Rochester, Carlton J</author><author>Stokes, Drew C</author><author>Hathaway, Stacie A</author><author>Fisher, Robert N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Responses in bird communities to wildland fires in southern California</title><secondary-title>Fire Ecology Special Issue</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Fire Ecology Special Issue</full-title></periodical><pages>63-82</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>coastal sage scrub</keyword><keyword>southern california</keyword><keyword>bird communities</keyword><keyword>chaparral</keyword><keyword>fire ecology special issue</keyword><keyword>grassland</keyword><keyword>oak woodland</keyword><keyword>riparian</keyword><keyword>san diego county</keyword><keyword>wildland fire</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.4996/fireecology.0402063</electronic-resource-num><abstract>There is a growing body of literature covering the responses of bird species to wildland fire events. Our study was unique among these because we investigated the effects of large-scale wildland fires on entire bird communities across multiple vegetation types. We conducted avian point counts during the breeding seasons for two years before and two years after the Cedar and Otay Fires in 2003 in southern California. Our balanced sampling effort took place at two sites, one low-elevation and one high-elevation, each containing replicate stations (burned and unburned) within five vegetation types: chaparral, coastal sage scrub, grassland, oak woodland, and riparian. Although fire caused some degree of change in the vegetation structure at all of our impacted survey points, we found that the post-fire shrub and tree cover was significantly lower in only two of the vegetation types within the low-elevation site, coastal sage scrub and chaparral. We found no significant changes in cover at the high-elevation site. Using univariate and multivariate analyses, we tested whether the fires were associated with a change in bird species diversity, community structure, and the relative abundance of individuals within a species. We found that species diversity changed in only one circumstance: it increased in coastal sage scrub at the low- elevation site. Multivariate analyses revealed significant differences in the post-fire bird community structure in the low-elevation chaparral, low-elevation coastal sage scrub, and the high-elevation grassland communities. Vegetation characteristics altered by fire, such as decreases in shrub and tree cover, influenced the changes we observed in the bird communities. The relative abundance of some species (lazuli bunting [Passerina amoena] and horned lark [Eremophila alpestris]) significantly increased after the fires, while other species declined significantly (Anna’s hummingbird [Calypte anna], wrentit [Chamaea fasciata], and bushtit [Psaltriparus minimus]). We detected mixed results for the spotted towhee (Pipilo maculatus), which increased in burned chaparral and declined in burned coastal sage scrub within the low-elevation site. We suggest that the observed responses of birds to these fires may be attributed to: (1) the availability of nearby unburned refugia, (2) the continued suitability of post-fire vegetation at the study sites, and (3) the generally high mobility of this taxon.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70003633</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Engle, Diana L.</author><author>Sickman, James O.</author><author>Moore, Claudette M.</author><author>Esperanza, Annie M.</author><author>Melack, John M.</author><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biogeochemical legacy of prescribed fire in a giant sequoia - Mixed conifer forest: A 16-year record of watershed balances</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences</full-title></periodical><volume>113</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>_Invalid DOI</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0148-0227</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2006JG00391</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The effects of prescription burning on watershed balances of major ions in mixed conifer forest were examined in a 16-year paired catchment study in Sequoia National Park, California. The objective was to determine whether fire-related changes in watershed balances persist as long as estimated low-end natural fire-return intervals (≤10 years), and whether cumulative net export caused by fire could deplete nutrient stocks between successive fires. Inputs (wet + dry deposition) and outputs (stream export) of N, S, Cl−, HCO3 −, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, H+, and SiO2 were measured for 7 years preceding, and 9 years following, a prescribed burn of one of the catchments. After fire, runoff coefficients increased by 7% (in dry years) to 35% (in wet years). Inorganic N was elevated in stream water for 3 years after fire. Increased export of water, SO4 2−, Cl−, SiO2, and base cations continued through the end of the study. Pools and processes attributed to fire led to the cumulative loss, per hectare, of 1.2 kg N, 16 kg S, 25 kg Cl−, 130 kg Ca2+, 19 kg Mg2+, 71 kg Na+, 29 kg K+ and 192 kg Si, above that predicted by prefire regression equations relating export in the paired catchments. This additional export equaled &lt;1% of the N, up to one-third of the Ca and Mg, and up to three-fourths of the K, contained in the forest floor prior to combustion. Changes in watershed balances indicated that low-end natural fire-return intervals may prevent complete reaccumulation of several elements between fires.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70000551</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Linkhart, Brian D</author><author>Evers, Erin M</author><author>Megler, Julie D</author><author>Palm, Eric C</author><author>Salipante, Catherine M</author><author>Yanco, Scott W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>First observed instance of polygyny in flammulated owls</title><secondary-title>Wilson Journal of Ornithology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Wilson Journal of Ornithology</full-title></periodical><pages>645-648</pages><volume>120</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>BIRDS -- Infancy</keyword><keyword>BIRDS of prey</keyword><keyword>COURTSHIP in animals</keyword><keyword>FLAMMULATED owl</keyword><keyword>POLYGYNY</keyword><keyword>SEX ratio</keyword><keyword>SEXUAL behavior in animals</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>15594491</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1676/07-029.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We document the first observed instance of polygyny in Flammulated Owls (Otus flammeolus) and the first among insectivorous raptors. Chronologies of the male's two nests, which were 510 m apart, were separated by nearly 2 weeks. Each brood initially consisted of three owlets, similar to the mean brood size in monogamous pairs. The male delivered considerably fewer prey to the secondary nest, compared with prey-delivery rates at nests of monogamous males during the nestling period. Evidence suggested that all owlets fledged from the primary brood, but only one fledged from the secondary brood. We were uncertain of the cause of polygyny, but a possible explanation is the Hayman Fire shifted the operational sex ratio of the owls in favor of females. The extent of polygyny in Flammulated Owls may be limited by costs to the reproductive success of secondary females.

Our study developed relative annual plant growth models as proxies for annual plant cover using metrics that captured phenological variability in Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) satellite images. We used landscape phenologies revealed in MODIS data together with ecological knowledge of annual plant seasonality to develop a suite of metrics to describe annual growth on a yearly basis. Each of these metrics was applied to temporally-composited MODIS-EVI images to develop a relative model of annual growth. Each model was evaluated by testing how well it predicted field estimates of annual cover collected during 2003 and 2005 at the Mojave National Preserve. The best performing metric was the spring difference metric, which compared the average of three spring MODIS-EVI composites of a given year to that of 2002, a year of record drought. The spring difference metric showed correlations with annual plant cover of R2 = 0.61 for 2005 and R2 = 0.47 for 2003. Although the correlation is moderate, we consider it supportive given the characteristics of the field data, which were collected for a different study in a localized area and are not ideal for calibration to MODIS pixels. A proxy for annual growth potential was developed from the spring difference metric of 2005 for use as an environmental data layer in desert tortoise habitat modeling. The application of the spring difference metric to other imagery years presents potential for other applications such as fuels, invasive species, and dust-emission monitoring in the Mojave Desert.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70033176</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hossack, B R</author><author>Corn, P S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Wildfire effects on water temperature and selection of breeding sites by the Boreal Toad (Bufo boreas) in seasonal wetlands</title><secondary-title>Herpetological Conservation and Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Herpetological Conservation and Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>46-54</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70010043</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Laird, David A.</author><author>Chappell, Mark A.</author><author>Martens, Dean A.</author><author>Wershaw, Robert L.</author><author>Thompson, Michael</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Distinguishing black carbon from biogenic humic substances in soil clay fractions</title><secondary-title>Geoderma</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geoderma</full-title></periodical><pages>115-122</pages><volume>143</volume><issue>1-2</issue><keywords><keyword>Charcoal</keyword><keyword>Black carbon</keyword><keyword>Clay mineralogy</keyword><keyword>Clay-humic complexes</keyword><keyword>Humic substances</keyword><keyword>humification</keyword><keyword>NMR spectroscopy</keyword><keyword>Soil organic matter</keyword><keyword>Thermogravimetric analysis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0016-7061</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.geoderma.2007.10.025</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Most models of soil humic substances include a substantial component of aromatic C either as the backbone of humic heteropolymers or as a significant component of supramolecular aggregates of degraded biopolymers. We physically separated coarse (0.2-2.0 μm e.s.d.), medium (0.02-0.2 μm e.s.d.), and fine (&gt; 0.02 μm e.s.d.) clay subfractions from three Midwestern soils and characterized the organic material associated with these subfractions using 13C-CPMAS-NMR, DTG, SEM-EDX, incubations, and radiocarbon age. Most of the C in the coarse clay subfraction was present as discrete particles (0.2-5 μm as seen in SEM images) of black carbon (BC) and consisted of approximately 60% aromatic C, with the remainder being a mixture of aliphatic, anomeric and carboxylic C. We hypothesize that BC particles were originally charcoal formed during prairie fires. As the BC particles aged in soil their surfaces were oxidized to form carboxylic groups and anomeric and aliphatic C accumulated in the BC particles either by adsorption of dissolved biogenic compounds from the soil solution or by direct deposition of biogenic materials from microbes living within the BC particles. The biogenic soil organic matter was physically separated with the medium and fine clay subfractions and was dominated by aliphatic, anomeric, and carboxylic C. The results indicate that the biogenic humic materials in our soils have little aromatic C, which is inconsistent with the traditional heteropolymer model of humic substances.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70033723</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rutherford, David W.</author><author>Wershaw, Robert L.</author><author>Reeves III, James B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Development of Acid Functional Groups and Lactones During the Thermal Degradation of Wood and Wood Components</title></titles><pages>43-43</pages><keywords><keyword>Biochar</keyword><keyword>Char</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>SIR - 2007-5013</isbn><abstract>Black carbon (pyrogenic materials including chars) in soils has been recognized as a substantial portion of soil organic matter, and has been shown to play a vital role in nutrient cycling; however, little is known concerning the properties of this material. Previous studies have largely been concerned with the creation of high-surface-area materials for use as sorbents. These materials have been manufactured at high temperature and have often been activated. Chars occurring in the environment can be formed over a wide range of temperature. Because it is extremely difficult to isolate black carbon once it has been incorporated in soils, chars produced in the laboratory under controlled conditions can be used to investigate the range of properties possible for natural chars. This report shows that charring conditions (temperature and time) have substantial impact on the acid functional group and lactone content of chars. Low temperatures (250°C) and long charring times (greater than 72 hours) produce chars with the highest acid functional group and lactone content. The charring of cellulose appears to be responsible for the creation of the acid functional group and lactones. The significance of this study is that low-temperature chars can have acid functional group contents comparable to humic materials (as high as 8.8 milliequivalents per gram). Acid functional group and lactone content decreases as charring temperature increases. The variation in formation conditions expected under natural fire conditions will result in a wide range of sorption properties for natural chars which are an important component of soil organic matter. By controlling the temperature and duration of charring, it is possible to tailor the sorption properties of chars, which may be used as soil amendments.</abstract><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2007/5013</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jain, Theresa B.</author><author>Gould, William A.</author><author>Graham, Russell T.</author><author>Pilliod, David S.</author><author>Lentile, Leigh B.</author><author>González, Grizelle</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Soil Burn Severity Index for Understanding Soil-fire Relations in Tropical Forests</title><secondary-title>AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment</full-title></periodical><pages>563-568</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>7</issue><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0044-7447</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1579/0044-7447-37.7.563</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Methods for evaluating the impact of fires within tropical forests are needed as fires become more frequent and human populations and demands on forests increase. Short- and long-term fire effects on soils are determined by the prefire, fire, and postfire environments. We placed these components within a fire-disturbance continuum to guide our literature synthesis and develop an integrated soil burn severity index. The soil burn severity index provides a set of indicators that reflect the range of conditions present after a fire. The index consists of seven levels, an unburned level and six other levels that describe a range of postfire soil conditions. We view this index as a tool for understanding the effects of fires on the forest floor, with the realization that as new information is gained, the index may be modified as warranted.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1579/0044-7447-37.7.563</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Santi, Paul M.</author><author>deWolfe, Victor G.</author><author>Higgins, Jerry D.</author><author>Cannon, Susan H.</author><author>Gartner, Joseph E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sources of debris flow material in burned areas</title><secondary-title>Geomorphology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geomorphology</full-title></periodical><pages>310-321</pages><volume>96</volume><issue>3-4</issue><keywords><keyword>Erosion</keyword><keyword>Debris flow</keyword><keyword>Levees</keyword><keyword>Rills</keyword><keyword>Scour</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0169-555X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.geomorph.2007.02.022</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The vulnerability of recently burned areas to debris flows has been well established. Likewise, it has been shown that many, if not most, post-fire debris flows are initiated by runoff and erosion and grow in size through erosion and scour by the moving debris flow, as opposed to landslide-initiated flows with little growth. To better understand the development and character of these flows, a study has been completed encompassing 46 debris flows in California, Utah, and Colorado, in nine different recently burned areas. For each debris flow, progressive debris production was measured at intervals along the length of the channel, and from these measurements graphs were developed showing cumulative volume of debris as a function of channel length. All 46 debris flows showed significant bulking by scour and erosion, with average yield rates for each channel ranging from 0.3 to 9.9 m3 of debris produced for every meter of channel length, with an overall average value of 2.5 m3/m. Significant increases in yield rate partway down the channel were identified in 87% of the channels, with an average of a three-fold increase in yield rate. Yield rates for short reaches of channels (up to several hundred meters) ranged as high as 22.3 m3/m. Debris was contributed from side channels into the main channels for 54% of the flows, with an average of 23% of the total debris coming from those side channels. Rill erosion was identified for 30% of the flows, with rills contributing between 0.1 and 10.5% of the total debris, with an average of 3%. Debris was deposited as levees in 87% of the flows, with most of the deposition occurring in the lower part of the basin. A median value of 10% of the total debris flow was deposited as levees for these cases, with a range from near zero to nearly 100%. These results show that channel erosion and scour are the dominant sources of debris in burned areas, with yield rates increasing significantly partway down the channel. Side channels are much more important sources of debris than rills. Levees are very common, but the size and effect on the amount of debris that reaches a canyon mouth is highly variable. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The objective was to reconstruct the ecohydrologic, vegetation, and fire history of the watershed for the last 2650 years to better understand past climate variations at the forest-steppe transition. The data suggest a period of limited bottom-water anoxia, relatively wet winters, and cool springs and summers from 2650 to 2100 cal yr BP (700-150 BC). Dry warm conditions occurred between 2100 and 850-800 cal yr BP (150 BC and AD 1100-1150), when the lake was anoxic, winter precipitation was low, and summer stratification was protracted. The data are consistent with overall warmer/drier conditions during the Medieval Climate Anomaly, although they suggest a shift towards wetter winters within that period. The period from 850 to 800 cal yr BP (AD 1100-1150) to 250 cal yr BP (AD 1700) was characterized by greater water-column mixing and cooler spring/summer conditions than before. In addition, fire activity shifted towards infrequent large events and pollen production was low. From 250 to 150 cal yr BP (AD 1700-1800), winter precipitation was moderate compared to previous conditions, and the lake was again stratified, suggesting warm summers. Between 150 and 42 cal yr BP (AD 1800-1908), winter precipitation increased and spring and summer conditions became moderate. Metal pollution, probably from regional mining operations, is evident in the 1870s. Large fires occurred between ca. 1800-1880, but in general the forests were more closed than before. The Crevice Lake record suggests that the last 150 years of Yellowstone's environmental history were characterized by intermediate conditions when compared with the previous 2500 years. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70000138</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Waldrop, Mark P.</author><author>Harden, Jennifer W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interactive effects of wildfire and permafrost on microbial communities and soil processes in an Alaskan black spruce forest</title><secondary-title>Global Change Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Change Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>2591-2602</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Alaska</keyword><keyword>Carbon cycling</keyword><keyword>Enzymes</keyword><keyword>Fungi</keyword><keyword>Lignin</keyword><keyword>Permafrost</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1365-2486</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01661.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Boreal forests contain significant quantities of soil carbon that may be oxidized to CO2 given future increases in climate warming and wildfire behavior. At the ecosystem scale, decomposition and heterotrophic respiration are strongly controlled by temperature and moisture, but we questioned whether changes in microbial biomass, activity, or community structure induced by fire might also affect these processes. We particularly wanted to understand whether postfire reductions in microbial biomass could affect rates of decomposition. Additionally, we compared the short-term effects of wildfire to the long-term effects of climate warming and permafrost decline. We compared soil microbial communities between control and recently burned soils that were located in areas with and without permafrost near Delta Junction, AK. In addition to soil physical variables, we quantified changes in microbial biomass, fungal biomass, fungal community composition, and C cycling processes (phenol oxidase enzyme activity, lignin decomposition, and microbial respiration). Five years following fire, organic surface horizons had lower microbial biomass, fungal biomass, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations compared with control soils. Reductions in soil fungi were associated with reductions in phenol oxidase activity and lignin decomposition. Effects of wildfire on microbial biomass and activity in the mineral soil were minor. Microbial community composition was affected by wildfire, but the effect was greater in nonpermafrost soils. Although the presence of permafrost increased soil moisture contents, effects on microbial biomass and activity were limited to mineral soils that showed lower fungal biomass but higher activity compared with soils without permafrost. Fungal abundance and moisture were strong predictors of phenol oxidase enzyme activity in soil. Phenol oxidase enzyme activity, in turn, was linearly related to both 13C lignin decomposition and microbial respiration in incubation studies. Taken together, these results indicate that reductions in fungal biomass in postfire soils and lower soil moisture in nonpermafrost soils reduced the potential of soil heterotrophs to decompose soil carbon. Although in the field increased rates of microbial respiration can be observed in postfire soils due to warmer soil conditions, reductions in fungal biomass and activity may limit rates of decomposition.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70033698</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Beever, Erik A.</author><author>Tausch, Robin J.</author><author>Thogmartin, Wayne E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multi-scale responses of vegetation to removal of horse grazing from Great Basin (USA) mountain ranges</title><secondary-title>Plant Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Plant Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>163-184</pages><volume>196</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Equus caballus</keyword><keyword>Nevada</keyword><keyword>Community ecology</keyword><keyword>Feral horses</keyword><keyword>Intermediate-disturbance hypothesis</keyword><keyword>Sagebrush communities</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1385-0237</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11258-007-9342-5</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Although free-roaming equids occur on all of the world's continents except Antarctica, very few studies (and none in the Great Basin, USA) have either investigated their grazing effects on vegetation at more than one spatial scale or compared characteristics of areas from which grazing has been removed to those of currently grazed areas. We compared characteristics of vegetation at 19 sites in nine mountain ranges of the western Great Basin; sites were either grazed by feral horses (Equus caballus) or had had horses removed for the last 10-14 years. We selected horse-occupied and horse-removed sites with similar aspect, slope, fire history, grazing pressure by cattle (minimal to none), and dominant vegetation (Artemisia tridentata). During 1997 and 1998, line-intercept transects randomly located within sites revealed that horse-removed sites exhibited 1.1-1.9 times greater shrub cover, 1.2-1.5 times greater total plant cover, 2-12 species greater plant species richness, and 1.9-2.9 times greater cover and 1.1-2.4 times greater frequency of native grasses than did horse-occupied sites. In contrast, sites with horses tended to have more grazing-resistant forbs and exotic plants. Direction and magnitude of landscape-scale results were corroborated by smaller-scale comparisons within horse-occupied sites of horse-trail transects and (randomly located) transects that characterized overall site conditions. Information-theoretic analyses that incorporated various subsets of abiotic variables suggested that presence of horses was generally a strong determinant of those vegetation-related variables that differed significantly between treatments, especially frequency and cover of grasses, but also species richness and shrub cover and frequency. In contrast, abiotic variables such as precipitation, site elevation, and soil erodibility best predicted characteristics such as forb cover, shrub frequency, and continuity of the shrub canopy. We found species richness of plants monotonically decreased across sites as grazing disturbance increased, suggesting that either the bell-shaped diversity-disturbance curve of the intermediate-disturbance hypothesis does not apply in this system or that most sites are already all on the greater-disturbance slope of the curve. In our study, numerous vegetation properties of less-grazed areas and sites differed notably from horse-grazed sites at local and landscape scales during a wetter and an average-precipitation year.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70031799</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hawbaker, Todd J.</author><author>Radeloff, Volker C.</author><author>Syphard, Alexandra D.</author><author>Zhu, Zhiliang</author><author>Stewart, Susan I.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Detection rates of the MODIS active fire product in the United States</title><secondary-title>Remote Sensing of Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Remote Sensing of Environment</full-title></periodical><pages>2656-2664</pages><volume>112</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Clouds</keyword><keyword>MOD14</keyword><keyword>MODIS active fire detection</keyword><keyword>MYD14</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>May 2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0034-4257</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.rse.2007.12.008</electronic-resource-num><abstract>MODIS active fire data offer new information about global fire patterns. However, uncertainties in detection rates can render satellite-derived fire statistics difficult to interpret. We evaluated the MODIS 1??km daily active fire product to quantify detection rates for both Terra and Aqua MODIS sensors, examined how cloud cover and fire size affected detection rates, and estimated how detection rates varied across the United States. MODIS active fire detections were compared to 361 reference fires (??? 18??ha) that had been delineated using pre- and post-fire Landsat imagery. Reference fires were considered detected if at least one MODIS active fire pixel occurred within 1??km of the edge of the fire. When active fire data from both Aqua and Terra were combined, 82% of all reference fires were found, but detection rates were less for Aqua and Terra individually (73% and 66% respectively). Fires not detected generally had more cloudy days, but not when the Aqua data were considered exclusively. MODIS detection rates decreased with fire size, and the size at which 50% of all fires were detected was 105??ha when combining Aqua and Terra (195??ha for Aqua and 334??ha for Terra alone). Across the United States, detection rates were greatest in the West, lower in the Great Plains, and lowest in the East. The MODIS active fire product captures large fires in the U.S. well, but may under-represent fires in areas with frequent cloud cover or rapidly burning, small, and low-intensity fires. We recommend that users of the MODIS active fire data perform individual validations to ensure that all relevant fires are included. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

To reduce fire risk, it is necessary to identify WUI housing areas that are more susceptible to wildfire. This is challenging, because wildfire patterns depend on fire behavior and spread, which in turn depend on ignition locations, weather conditions, the spatial arrangement of fuels, and topography. The goal of our study was to assess wildfire risk to a 60,000ha WUI area in northwestern Wisconsin while accounting for all of these factors. We conducted 6000 simulations with two dynamic fire models: Fire Area Simulator (FARSITE) and Minimum Travel Time (MTT) in order to map the spatial pattern of burn probabilities. Simulations were run under normal and extreme weather conditions to assess the effect of weather on fire spread, burn probability, and risk to structures. The resulting burn probability maps were intersected with maps of structure locations and land cover types. The simulations revealed clear hotspots of wildfire activity and a large range of wildfire risk to structures in the study area. As expected, the extreme weather conditions yielded higher burn probabilities over the entire landscape, as well as to different land cover classes and individual structures. Moreover, the spatial pattern of risk was significantly different between extreme and normal weather conditions. The results highlight the fact that extreme weather conditions not only produce higher fire risk than normal weather conditions, but also change the fine-scale locations of high risk areas in the landscape, which is of great importance for fire management in WUI areas. In addition, the choice of weather data may limit the potential for comparisons of risk maps for different areas and for extrapolating risk maps to future scenarios where weather conditions are unknown. Our approach to modeling wildfire risk to structures can aid fire risk reduction management activities by identifying areas with elevated wildfire risk and those most vulnerable under extreme weather conditions.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112709005210</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gartner, Joseph E</author><author>Cannon, Susan H</author><author>Helsel, Dennis R</author><author>Bandurraga, Mark</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multivariate Statistical Models for Predicting Sediment Yields from Southern California Watersheds</title></titles><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2009-1200</isbn><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20091200</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wilson, Jim</author><author>Melcher, C</author><author>Bowen, Z</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fort Collins Science Center Ecosystem Dynamics Branch</title></titles><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2008-3100</isbn><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/fs20083100</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book">6</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bentz, B.</author><author>Allen, C.D.</author><author>Ayres, M.</author><author>Berg, E.</author><author>Carroll, A.</author><author>Hansen, M.</author><author>Hicke, J.</author><author>Joyce, J.</author><author>Logan, J.</author><author>MacFarlane, W.</author><author>MacMahon, J.</author><author>Munson, S.</author><author>Negron, J.</author><author>Paine, T.</author><author>Powell, J.</author><author>Raffa, K.</author><author>Régnière, J.</author><author>Reid, M.</author><author>Romme, W.</author><author>Seybold, S.</author><author>Six, D.</author><author>Tomback, D.</author><author>Vandygriff, J.</author><author>Veblen, T.</author><author>White, M.</author><author>Witcosky, J.</author><author>Wood, D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bark Beetle Outbreaks in Western North America: Causes and Consequences.</title></titles><pages>42</pages><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Salt Lake City</pub-location><publisher>University of Utah Press</publisher><isbn>978-0- 87480965-7</isbn><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/pubs/43479</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>O'Donnell, Jonathan A.</author><author>Turetsky, Merritt R.</author><author>Harden, Jennifer W.</author><author>Manies, Kristen L.</author><author>Pruett, Lee E.</author><author>Shetler, Gordon</author><author>Neff, Jason C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interactive effects of fire, soil climate, and moss on CO2 fluxes in black spruce ecosystems of interior Alaska</title><secondary-title>Ecosystems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecosystems</full-title></periodical><pages>57-72</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Climate change</keyword><keyword>Fire</keyword><keyword>Boreal forest</keyword><keyword>Alaska</keyword><keyword>Carbon fluxes</keyword><keyword>Decomposition</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1432-9840</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10021-008-9206-4</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fire is an important control on the carbon (C) balance of the boreal forest region. Here, we present findings from two complementary studies that examine how fire modifies soil organic matter properties, and how these modifications influence rates of decomposition and C exchange in black spruce (Picea mariana) ecosystems of interior Alaska. First, we used laboratory incubations to explore soil temperature, moisture, and vegetation effects on CO2 and DOC production rates in burned and unburned soils from three study regions in interior Alaska. Second, at one of the study regions used in the incubation experiments, we conducted intensive field measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and ecosystem respiration (ER) across an unreplicated factorial design of burning (2 year post-fire versus unburned sites) and drainage class (upland forest versus peatland sites). Our laboratory study showed that burning reduced the sensitivity of decomposition to increased temperature, most likely by inducing moisture or substrate quality limitations on decomposition rates. Burning also reduced the decomposability of Sphagnum-derived organic matter, increased the hydrophobicity of feather moss-derived organic matter, and increased the ratio of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in both the upland and peatland sites. At the ecosystem scale, our field measurements indicate that the surface organic soil was generally wetter in burned than in unburned sites, whereas soil temperature was not different between the burned and unburned sites. Analysis of variance results showed that ER varied with soil drainage class but not by burn status, averaging 0.9 0.1 and 1.4 0.1 g C m(-2) d(-1) in the upland and peatland sites, respectively. However, a more complex general linear model showed that ER was controlled by an interaction between soil temperature, moisture, and burn status, and in general was less variable over time in the burned than in the unburned sites. Together, findings from these studies across different spatial scales suggest that although fire can create some soil climate conditions more conducive to rapid decomposition, rates of C release from soils may be constrained following fire by changes in moisture and/or substrate quality that impede rates of decomposition.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032787</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Carrara, Paul E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Preliminary Map of Landslide Deposits in the Mesa Verde National Park Area, Colorado</title></titles><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>3090</isbn><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sim3090</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Balshi, Michael S.</author><author>McGuire, A.

The temporal and spatial dynamics of fire are likely to be altered as climate continues to change. In this study, we ask the question: how will area burned in boreal North America by wildfire respond to future changes in climate? To evaluate this question, we developed temporally and spatially explicit relationships between air temperature and fuel moisture codes derived from the Canadian Fire Weather Index System to estimate annual area burned at 2.51 (latitu- delongitude) resolution using a Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS) approach across Alaska and Canada. Burned area was substantially more predictable in the western portion of boreal North America than in eastern Canada. Burned area was also not very predictable in areas of substantial topographic relief and in areas along the transition between boreal forest and tundra. At the scale of Alaska and western Canada, the empirical fire models explain on the order of 82% of the variation in annual area burned for the period 1960–2002. July temperature was the most frequently occurring predictor across all models, but the fuel moisture codes for the months June through August (as a group) entered the models as the most important predictors of annual area burned. To predict changes in the temporal and spatial dynamics of fire under future climate, the empirical fire models used output from the Canadian Climate Center CGCM2 global climate model to predict annual area burned through the year 2100 across Alaska and western Canada. Relative to 1991–2000, the results suggest that average area burned per decade will double by 2041–2050 and will increase on the order of 3.5–5.5 times by the last decade of the 21st century. To improve the ability to better predict wildfire across Alaska and Canada, future research should focus on incor- porating additional effects of long-term and successional vegetation changes on area burned to account more fully for interactions among fire, climate, and vegetation dynamics.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032401</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moody, John A.</author><author>Kinner, David A.</author><author>Úbeda, Xavier</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Linking hydraulic properties of fire-affected soils to infiltration and water repellency</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hydrology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hydrology</full-title></periodical><pages>291-303</pages><volume>379</volume><issue>3-4</issue><keywords><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Disk infiltrometer</keyword><keyword>Hydraulic conductivity</keyword><keyword>Infiltration</keyword><keyword>Sorptivity</keyword><keyword>Water repellency</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-1694</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.10.015</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Heat from wildfires can produce a two-layer system composed of extremely dry soil covered by a layer of ash, which when subjected to rainfall, may produce extreme floods. To understand the soil physics controlling runoff for these initial conditions, we used a small, portable disk infiltrometer to measure two hydraulic properties: (1) near-saturated hydraulic conductivity, Kf and (2) sorptivity, S(θi), as a function of initial soil moisture content, θi, ranging from extremely dry conditions (θi &lt; 0.02 cm3 cm-3) to near saturation. In the field and in the laboratory replicate measurements were made of ash, reference soils, soils unaffected by fire, and fire-affected soils. Each has a different degrees of water repellency that influences Kf and S(θi). Values of Kf ranged from 4.5 × 10-3 to 53 × 10-3 cm s-1 for ash; from 0.93 × 10-3 to 130 × 10-3 cm s-1 for reference soils; and from 0.86 × 10-3 to 3.0 × 10-3 cm s-1, for soil unaffected by fire, which had the lowest values of Kf. Measurements indicated that S(θi) could be represented by an empirical non-linear function of θi with a sorptivity maximum of 0.18-0.20 cm s-0.5, between 0.03 and 0.08 cm3 cm-3. This functional form differs from the monotonically decreasing non-linear functions often used to represent S(θi) for rainfall-runoff modeling. The sorptivity maximum may represent the combined effects of gravity, capillarity, and adsorption in a transitional domain corresponding to extremely dry soil, and moreover, it may explain the observed non-linear behavior, and the critical soil-moisture threshold of water repellent soils. Laboratory measurements of Kf and S(θi) are the first for ash and fire-affected soil, but additional measurements are needed of these hydraulic properties for in situ fire-affected soils. They provide insight into water repellency behavior and infiltration under extremely dry conditions. Most importantly, they indicate how existing rainfall-runoff models can be modified to accommodate a possible two-layer system in extremely dry conditions. These modified models can be used to predict floods from burned watersheds under these initial conditions.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70034358</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Walter, William David</author><author>Zimmerman, Teresa J.</author><author>Leslie, Jr., David M.</author><author>Jenks, Jonathan a.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dietary Response of Sympatric Deer to Fire Using Stable Isotope Analysis of Liver Tissue</title><secondary-title>Wildlife Biology in Practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Wildlife Biology in Practice</full-title></periodical><pages>128-135</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2461/wbp.2009.5.13</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotopes in biological samples from large herbivores identify photosynthetic pathways (C3 vs. C4) of plants they consumed and can elucidate potential nutritional characteristics of dietary selection. Because large herbivores consume a diversity of forage types, δ13C and δ15N in their tissue can index ingested and assimilated diets through time. We assessed δ13C and δ15N in metabolically active liver tissue of sympatric mule deer ( Odocoileus hemionus ) and white-tailed deer ( O. virginianus ) to identify dietary disparity resulting from use of burned and unburned areas in a largely forested landscape. Interspecific variation in dietary disparity of deer was documented 2–3 years post-fire in response to lag-time effects of vegetative response to burning and seasonal (i.e., summer, winter) differences in forage type. Liver δ13C for mule deer were lower during winter and higher during summer 2 years post-fire on burned habitat compared to unburned habitat suggesting different forages were consumed by mule deer in response to fire. Liver δ15N for both species were higher on burned than unburned habitat during winter and summer suggesting deer consumed more nutritious forage on burned habitat during both seasons 2 and 3 years post-fire. Unlike traditional methods of dietary assessment that do not measure uptake of carbon and nitrogen from dietary components, analyses of stable isotopes in liver or similar tissue elucidated δ13C and δ15N assimilation from seasonal dietary components and resulting differences in the foraging ecology of sympatric species in response to fire.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70035575</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hoefen, Todd M</author><author>Kokaly, Raymond F</author><author>Martin, Deborah a</author><author>Rochester, Carlton</author><author>Plumlee, Geoffrey S</author><author>Mendez, Greg</author><author>Reichard, Eric G</author><author>Fisher, Robert N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sample collection of ash and burned soils from the October 2007 southern California Wildfires</title></titles><pages>64 pp-64 pp</pages><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>OFR - 2009-1038</isbn><abstract>Between November 2 through 9, 2007 scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) collected samples of ash and burned soils from 28 sites in six areas burned as a result of the Southern California wildfires of October 2007, including the Harris, Witch, Santiago, Ammo, Canyon, and Grass Valley Fires. The primary goal of this sampling and analysis effort was to understand how differences in ash and burned soil composition relate to vegetation type, underlying bedrock geology, burn intensity, and residential versus wildland. Sampling sites were chosen with the input of local experts from the USGS Water Resources and Biological Resources Disciplines to help understand possible effects of the fires on water supplies, ecosystems, and endangered species. The sampling was also carried out in conjunction with detailed field analysis of the spectral reflectance characteristics of the ash, so that chemical and mineralogical characteristics of the field samples could be used to help interpret data collected as part of an airborne, hyperspectral remote-sensing survey of several of the burned areas in mid-late November, 2007. This report presents an overview of the field sampling methodologies used to collect the samples, includes representative photos of the sites sampled, and summarizes important characteristics of each of the collection sites. In this report we use the term “ash” to refer collectively to white mineral ash, which results from full combustion of vegetation and black charred organic matter from partial combustion of vegetation or other materials. These materials were found to be intermingled as a deposited residue on the soil surface following the Southern California fires of 2007.</abstract><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2009/1038/pdf/OF09-1038.pdf%5Cnhttp://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2009/1038/</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pausas, Juli G.</author><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Burning Story: The Role of Fire in the History of Life</title><secondary-title>BioScience</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BioScience</full-title></periodical><pages>593-601</pages><volume>59</volume><issue>7</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>00063568</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1525/bio.2009.59.7.10</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Ecologists, biogeographers, and paleobotanists have long thought that climate and soils controlled the distribution of ecosystems, with the role of fire getting only limited appreciation.

The importance of fire has waxed and waned in association with changes in climate and paleoatmospheric conditions. Well before the emergence of humans on Earth, fire played a key role in the origins of plant adaptations as well as in the distribution of ecosystems. Humans initiated a new stage in ecosystem fire, using it to make the Earth more suited to their lifestyle. However, as human populations have expanded their use of fire, their actions have come to dominate some ecosystems and change natural processes in ways that threaten the sustainability of some landscapes.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-lookup/doi/10.1525/bio.2009.59.7.10</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bowman, David M.J.S.</author><author>Balch, Jennifer K.</author><author>Artaxo, Paulo</author><author>Bond, William J.</author><author>Carlson, Jean M.</author><author>Cochrane, Mark A.</author><author>D'Antonio, Carla M.</author><author>DeFries, Ruth S.</author><author>Doyle, John C.</author><author>Harrison, Sandy P.</author><author>Johnston, Fay H.</author><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author><author>Krawchuk, Meg A.</author><author>Kull, Christian A.</author><author>Marston, J.

We further examine how communities and fire managers have responded to these changes and what additional adaptations could be put in place. We engage a variety of social science methods, including demographic analysis, semi-structured interviews, surveys, workshops and observations of public meetings. This work is part of an interdisciplinary study of feedback and interactions between climate, vegetation, fire and human components of the Boreal forest social-ecological system of interior Alaska. We have learned that although urban and rural communities in interior Alaska face similar increased exposure to wildfire as a result of climate change, important differences exist in their sensitivity to these biophysical, climate-induced changes. In particular, reliance on wild foods, delayed suppression response, financial resources and institutional connections vary between urban and rural communities. These differences depend largely on social, economic and institutional factors, and are not necessarily related to biophysical climate impacts per se. Fire management and suppression action motivated by political, economic or other pressures can serve as unintentional or indirect adaptation to climate change. However, this indirect response alone may not sufficiently reduce vulnerability to a changing fire regime. More deliberate and strategic responses may be required, given the magnitude of the expected climate change and the likelihood of an intensification of the fire regime in interior Alaska</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70168689</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shinneman, Douglas J.</author><author>Baker, William L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Environmental and climatic variables as potential drivers of post-fire cover of cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) in seeded and unseeded semiarid ecosystems</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</full-title></periodical><pages>191-202</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Non-native</keyword><keyword>Invasive species</keyword><keyword>Piñon-juniper woodland</keyword><keyword>Post-fire seeding</keyword><keyword>Sagebrush shrubland</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1049-8001</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1071/WF07043</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Cheatgrass, a non-native annual grass, dominates millions of hectares in semiarid ecosystems of the Intermountain West (USA). Post-fire invasions can reduce native species diversity and alter ecological processes. To curb cheatgrass invasion, land managers often seed recently burned areas with perennial competitor species. We sampled vegetation within burned (1–9 years post-fire) and nearby unburned (representing pre-fire) piñon–juniper (Pinus edulis– Juniperus osteosperma) woodland and sagebrush (Artemisia sp.) in western Colorado to analyze variables that might explain cheatgrass cover after fire. A multiple regression model suggests higher cheatgrass cover after fire with: (1) sagebrush v. piñon–juniper; (2) higher pre-fire cover of annual forbs; (3) increased time since fire; (4) lower pre-fire cover of biological soil crust; and (5) lower precipitation the year before fire. Time since fire, which coincided with higher precipitation, accounts for most of the variability in cheatgrass cover. No significant difference was found in mean cheatgrass cover between seeded and unseeded plots over time. However, negative relationships with pre-fire biological soil crust cover and native species richness suggest livestock-degraded areas are more susceptible to post-fire invasion.

However, interactions between soil thermal and hydrological processes are not adequately understood in cold regions, where the frozen soil, fire disturbance, and soil drainage play important roles in controlling interactions among these processes. These interactions were investigated with a new ecosystem model framework, the dynamic organic soil version of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model, that incorporates an efficient and stable numerical scheme for simulating soil thermal and hydrological dynamics within soil profiles that contain a live moss horizon, fibrous and amorphous organic horizons, and mineral soil horizons. The performance of the model was evaluated for a tundra burn site that had both preburn and postburn measurements, two black spruce fire chronosequences (representing space-for-time substitutions in well and intermediately drained conditions), and a poorly drained black spruce site. Although space-for-time substitutions present challenges in model-data comparison, the model demonstrates substantial ability in simulating the dynamics of evapotranspiration, soil temperature, active layer depth, soil moisture, and water table depth in response to both climate variability and fire disturbance. Several differences between model simulations and field measurements identified key challenges for evaluating/improving model performance that include (1) proper representation of discrepancies between air temperature and ground surface temperature; (2) minimization of precipitation biases in the driving data sets; (3) improvement of the measurement accuracy of soil moisture in surface organic horizons; and (4) proper specification of organic horizon depth/properties, and soil thermal conductivity.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70173864</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schwilk, Dylan W.</author><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author><author>Knapp, Eric E.</author><author>Mciver, James</author><author>Bailey, John D.</author><author>Fettig, Christopher J.</author><author>Fiedler, Carl E.</author><author>Harrod, Richy J.</author><author>Moghaddas, Jason J.</author><author>Outcalt, Kenneth W.</author><author>Skinner, Carl N.</author><author>Stephens, Scott L.</author><author>Waldrop, Thomas A.</author><author>Yaussy, Daniel A.</author><author>Youngblood, Andrew</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The national Fire and Fire Surrogate study: Effects of fuel reduction methods on forest vegetation structure and fuels</title><secondary-title>Ecological Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>285-304</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Species richness</keyword><keyword>Forest management</keyword><keyword>Delayed mortality</keyword><keyword>Dry forests</keyword><keyword>Hazard reduction</keyword><keyword>Prescribed burning</keyword><keyword>Thinning.</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1051-0761</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1890/07-1747.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Changes in vegetation and fuels were evaluated from measurements taken before and after fuel reduction treatments (prescribed fire, mechanical treatments, and the combination of the two) at 12 Fire and Fire Surrogate (FFS) sites located in forests with a surface fire regime across the conterminous United States. To test the relative effectiveness of fuel reduction treatments and their effect on ecological parameters we used an information-theoretic approach on a suite of 12 variables representing the overstory (basal area and live tree, sapling, and snag density), the understory (seedling density, shrub cover, and native and alien herbaceous species richness), and the most relevant fuel parameters for wildfire damage (height to live crown, total fuel bed mass, forest floor mass, and woody fuel mass). In the short term (one year after treatment), mechanical treatments were more effective at reducing overstory tree density and basal area and at increasing quadratic mean tree diameter. Prescribed fire treatments were more effective at creating snags, killing seedlings, elevating height to live crown, and reducing surface woody fuels. Overall, the response to fuel reduction treatments of the ecological variables presented in this paper was generally maximized by the combined mechanical plus burning treatment. If the management goal is to quickly produce stands with fewer and larger diameter trees, less surface fuel mass, and greater herbaceous species richness, the combined treatment gave the most desirable results. However, because mechanical plus burning treatments also favored alien species invasion at some sites, monitoring and control need to be part of the prescription when using this treatment.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70034910</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hockaday, W.

The OR of the terrestrial biosphere must be well characterized to accurately estimate the terrestrial CO2 sink using atmospheric measurements of changing O2 and CO2 levels. To estimate the OR of the terrestrial biosphere, measurements are needed of changes in the OR of aboveground and belowground carbon pools associated with decadal timescale disturbances (e.g., land use change and fire). The OR of aboveground pools can be measured using conventional approaches including elemental analysis. However, measuring the OR of soil carbon pools is technically challenging, and few soil OR data are available. In this paper we test three solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques for measuring soil OR, all based on measurements of the closely related parameter, organic carbon oxidation state (Cox). Two of the three techniques make use of a molecular mixing model which converts NMR spectra into concentrations of a standard suite of biological molecules of known C ox. The third technique assigns Cox values to each peak in the NMR spectrum. We assess error associated with each technique using pure chemical compounds and plant biomass standards whose Cox and OR values can be directly measured by elemental analyses. The most accurate technique, direct polarization solid-state 13C NMR with the molecular mixing model, agrees with elemental analyses to ±0.036 Cox units (±0.009 OR units). Using this technique, we show a large natural variability in soil Cox and OR values. Soil Cox values have a mean of -0.26 and a range from -0.45 to 0.30, corresponding to OR values of 1.08 ± 0.06 and a range from 0.96 to 1.22. We also estimate the OR of the carbon flux from a boreal forest fire. Analysis of soils from nearby intact soil profiles imply that soil carbon losses associated with the fire had an OR of 1.091 (±0.003). Fire appears to be a major factor driving the soil C pool to higher oxidation states and lower OR values. Episodic fluxes caused by disturbances like fire may have substantially different ORs from ecosystem respiration fluxes and therefore should be better quantified to reduce uncertainties associated with our understanding of the global atmospheric carbon budget.

Annual post-fire sediment yields were computed and grouped into four measurement methods (hillslope point and plot measurements, channel measurements of suspended-sediment and sediment erosion or deposition volumes). Post-fire sediment yields for each method were then grouped into eight different rainfall regimes. Mean sediment yield from channels (240 t ha–1) was significantly greater than from hillslopes (82 t ha–1). This indicated that on the time scale of wildfire (10–100 years) channels were the primary sources of available sediment. A lack of correlation of sediment yield with topographic slope and soil erodibility further suggested that sediment availability may be more important than slope or soil erodibility in predicting post-fire sediment yields. The maximum post-fire sediment yields were comparable to long-term sediment yields from major rivers of the world. Based on 80 years of data from the literature, wildfires have been an important geomorphic agent of landscape change when linked with sufficient rainfall. These effects are limited in spatial scale to the immediate burned area and to downstream channel corridors.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032717</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mitra, Siddhartha</author><author>Zimmerman, Andrew R.</author><author>Hunsinger, Glendon B.</author><author>Willard, Debra</author><author>Dunn, Joshua C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Holocene record of climate-driven shifts in coastal carbon sequestration</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>36</volume><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0094-8276</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2008GL036875</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A sediment core collected in the mesohaline portion of Chesapeake Bay was found to contain periods of increased delivery of refractory black carbon (BC) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The BC was most likely produced by biomass combustion during four centennial-scale dry periods as indicated by the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), beginning in the late Medieval Warm Period of 1100 CE. In contrast, wetter periods were associated with increased non-BC organic matter influx into the bay, likely due to greater runoff and associated nutrient delivery. In addition, an overall increase in both BC and non-BC organic matter deposition during the past millennium may reflect a shift in climate regime. The finding that carbon sequestration in the coastal zone responds to climate fluctuations at both centennial and millennial scales through fire occurrence and nutrient delivery has implications for past and future climate predictions. Drought-induced fires may lead, on longer timescales, to greater carbon sequestration and, therefore, represent a negative climate feedback.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70034973</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Serieyssol, C.

We used paleolimnology to determine how these stressors impacted Namakan Lake in comparison to a control lake (Lac La Croix) that was not subject to damming and hydromanagement. One core was retrieved from each lake for Pb-210 dating and analysis of loss-on-ignition and diatom composition. Pb-210-derived chronologies from the cores indicated that sediment accumulation increased after logging and damming in Namakan Lake; Lac La Croix showed no significant change. Loss-on-ignition analysis also showed an increase in concentration and accumulation of inorganic material after damming in Namakan Lake; again, minimal changes were observed in Lac La Croix. Diatom communities in both lakes displayed community shifts at the peak of logging. Simultaneous, post-1970s diatom community changes may reflect regional climate warming. Taxonomic richness in Namakan Lake decreased sharply after damming and the peak of logging, and was followed by a slow recovery to taxonomic richness similar to that prior to damming. Ecological variability among post-damming diatom communities, however, was greater in Namakan Lake than in Lac La Croix. A diatom calibration set was used to reconstruct historical conductivity and total phosphorus (TP). Lac La Croix showed little historical change in conductivity and TP. In contrast, conductivity increased for several decades in Namakan Lake after damming, possibly in relation to several large fires and flooding. Total phosphorus also increased in Namakan Lake after damming, with a possible decrease in the last decade to pre-damming TP levels.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70035544</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sharp, Nicholas W.</author><author>Mitchell, Michael S.</author><author>Grand, James B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sources, Sinks, and Spatial Ecology of Cotton Mice in Longleaf Pine Stands Undergoing Restoration</title><secondary-title>Journal of Mammalogy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Mammalogy</full-title></periodical><pages>1440-1448</pages><volume>90</volume><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-2372</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1644/08-MAMM-A-064R2.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Fire and Fire Surrogate study—a replicated, manipulative experiment—sought the most economically and ecologically efficient way to restore the nation's fire-maintained ecosystems. As part of this study, we conducted a 3-year mark–recapture study, comprising 105,000 trap-nights, to assess demographic responses of cotton mice (Peromyscus gossypinus) to Fire and Fire Surrogate treatments at the Gulf Coastal Plain site, where longleaf pine was the ecosystem to be restored. We compared competing models to evaluate restoration effects on variation in apparent survival and recruitment over time, space, and treatment, and incorporated measures of available source habitat for cotton mice with reverse-time modeling to infer immigration from outside the study area. The top-ranked survival model contained only variation over time, but the closely ranked 2nd and 3rd models included variation over space and treatment, respectively. The top 4 recruitment models all included effects for availability of source habitat and treatments. Burning appeared to degrade habitat quality for cotton mice, showing demographic characteristics of a sink, but treatments combining fire with thinning of trees or application of herbicide to the understory appeared to improve habitat quality, possibly creating sources. Bottomland hardwoods outside the study also acted as sources by providing immigrants to experimental units. Models suggested that population dynamics operated over multiple spatial scales. Treatments applied to 15-ha stands probably only caused local variation in vital rates within the larger population.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article-lookup/doi/10.1644/08-MAMM-A-064R2.1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Erickson, By Heidi J</author><author>Aldridge, Cameron L</author><author>Hobbs, N Thompson</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Progress Report : Stratton Ecological Research Site — An Experimental Approach to Assess Effects of Various Grazing Treatments on Vegetation and Wildlife Communities Across Managed Burns and Habitat Controls</title></titles><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2009-1016</isbn><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20091016</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jones, Benjamin M.</author><author>Kolden, Crystal A.</author><author>Jandt, Randi</author><author>Abatzoglou, John T.</author><author>Urban, Frank</author><author>Arp, Christopher D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fire Behavior, Weather, and Burn Severity of the 2007 Anaktuvuk River Tundra Fire, North Slope, Alaska</title><secondary-title>Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research</full-title></periodical><pages>309-316</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1523-0430</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1657/1938-4246-41.3.309</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In 2007, the Anaktuvuk River Fire (ARF) became the largest recorded tundra fire Oil the North Slope of Alaska. The ARF burned for nearly three months. consuming more than 100,000 ha. At its peak in early September, the ARF burned at a rate of 7000 ha d(-1). The conditions potentially responsible for this large tundra fire include modeled record high summer temperature and record low summer precipitation, I late-season high-pressure system located over the Beaufort Sea, extremely dry soil conditions throughout the summer, and Sustained Southerly winds during the period of vegetation senescence.

While this study provides information that may aid in the prediction of Future large tundra Fires in northern Alaska, the fact that three other tundra fires that occurred in 2007 combined to burn less than 1000 ha Suggests site specific complexities associated with tundra fires on the North Slope, which may hamper the development Of tundra fire forecasting models.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1657/1938-4246-41.3.309</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stryker, Timothy</author><author>Jones, Brenda</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Disaster response and the international charter program</title><secondary-title>Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing</full-title></periodical><pages>1342-1344</pages><volume>75</volume><issue>12</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0099-1112</isbn></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Miller, Jay D.</author><author>Knapp, Eric E.</author><author>Key, Carl H.</author><author>Skinner, Carl N.</author><author>Isbell, Clint J.</author><author>Creasy, R.

Fire severity, defined as the degree to which a site has been altered, is often the variable mapped. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) used in an absolute difference change detection protocol (dNBR), has become the remote sensing method of choice for US Federal land management agencies to map fire severity due to wildland fire. However, absolute differenced vegetation indices are correlated to the pre-fire chlorophyll content of the vegetation occurring within the fire perimeter. Normalizing dNBR to produce a relativized dNBR (RdNBR) removes the biasing effect of the pre-fire condition. Employing RdNBR hypothetically allows creating categorical classifications using the same thresholds for fires occurring in similar vegetation types without acquiring additional calibration field data on each fire. In this paper we tested this hypothesis by developing thresholds on random training datasets, and then comparing accuracies for (1) fires that occurred within the same geographic region as the training dataset and in similar vegetation, and (2) fires from a different geographic region that is climatically and floristically similar to the training dataset region but supports more complex vegetation structure. We additionally compared map accuracies for three measures of fire severity: the composite burn index (CBI), percent change in tree canopy cover, and percent change in tree basal area. User's and producer's accuracies were highest for the most severe categories, ranging from 70.7% to 89.1%. Accuracies of the moderate fire severity category for measures describing effects only to trees (percent change in canopy cover and basal area) indicated that the classifications were generally not much better than random. Accuracies of the moderate category for the CBI classifications were somewhat better, averaging in the 50%-60% range. These results underscore the difficulty in isolating fire effects to individual vegetation strata when fire effects are mixed. We conclude that the models presented here and in Miller and Thode ([Miller, J.D. &amp; Thode, A.E., (2007). Quantifying burn severity in a heterogeneous landscape with a relative version of the delta Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR). Remote Sensing of Environment, 109, 66-80.]) can produce fire severity classifications (using either CBI, or percent change in canopy cover or basal area) that are of similar accuracy in fires not used in the original calibration process, at least in conifer dominated vegetation types in Mediterranean-climate California.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032808</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ostoja, Steven M.</author><author>Schupp, Eugene W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Conversion of sagebrush shrublands to exotic annual grasslands negatively impacts small mammal communities</title><secondary-title>Diversity and Distributions</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Diversity and Distributions</full-title></periodical><pages>863-870</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Biological invasions</keyword><keyword>Small mammals</keyword><keyword>Big sagebrush</keyword><keyword>Great Basin desert</keyword><keyword>Rodent communities</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>13669516\n14724642</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1472-4642.2009.00593.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Abstract Aim The exotic annual cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is fast replacing sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) communities throughout the Great Basin Desert and nearby regions in the Western United States, impacting native plant communities and altering fire regimes, which contributes to the long-term persistence of this weedy species. The effect of this conversion on native faunal communities remains largely unexamined. We assess the impact of conversion from native perennial to exotic annual plant communities on desert rodent communities. Location Wyoming big sagebrush shrublands and nearby sites previously converted to cheatgrass-dominated annual grasslands in the Great Basin Desert, Utah, USA. Methods At two sites in Tooele County, Utah, USA, we investigated with Sherman live trapping whether intact sagebrush vegetation and nearby converted Bromus tectorum-dominated vegetation differed in rodent abundance, diversity and community composition. Results Rodent abundance and species richness were considerably greater in sagebrush plots than in cheatgrass-dominated plots. Nine species were captured in sagebrush plots; five of these were also trapped in cheatgrass plots, all at lower abundances than in the sagebrush. In contrast, cheatgrass-dominated plots had no species that were not found in sagebrush. In addition, the site that had been converted to cheatgrass longer had lower abundances of rodents than the site more recently converted to cheatgrass-dominated plots. Despite large differences in abundances and species richness, Simpson's D diversity and Shannon-Wiener diversity and Brillouin evenness indices did not differ between sagebrush and cheatgrass-dominated plots. Main conclusions This survey of rodent communities in native sagebrush and in converted cheatgrass-dominated vegetation suggests that the abundances and community composition of rodents may be shifting, potentially at the larger spatial scale of the entire Great Basin, where cheatgrass continues to invade and dominate more landscape at a rapid rate.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70036792</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rollins, Matthew G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>LANDFIRE: A nationally consistent vegetation, wildland fire, and fuel assessment</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</full-title></periodical><pages>235-249</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1049-8001</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1071/WF08088</electronic-resource-num><abstract>LANDFIRE is a 5-year, multipartner project producing consistent and comprehensive maps and data describ-ing vegetation, wildland fuel, fire regimes and ecological departure from historical conditions across the United States.

These altered structural conditions may contribute to increased probability of unnaturally severe wildfires, susceptibility to uncharacteristic insect outbreaks, and drought-related mortality. Broad-scale fuel reduction and restoration treatments are proposed to promote stand development on trajectories toward more sustainable structures. Little research to date, however, has quantified the effects of these treatments on the ecosystem, especially delayed and latent tree mortality resulting directly or indirectly from treatments. In this paper, we explore complex hypotheses relating to the cascade of effects that influence ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) mortality using structural equation modeling (SEM). We used annual census and plot data through six growing seasons after thinning and four growing seasons after burning from a replicated, operational-scale, completely randomized experiment conducted in northeastern Oregon, USA, as part of the national Fire and Fire Surrogate study. Treatments included thin, burn, thin followed by burn (thin + burn), and control. Burn and thin + burn treatments increased the proportion of dead trees while the proportion of dead trees declined or remained constant in thin and control units, although the density of dead trees was essentially unchanged with treatment. Most of the new mortality (96%) occurred within two years of treatment and was attributed to bark beetles. Bark beetle-caused tree mortality, while low overall, was greatest in thin + burn treatments. SEM results indicate that the probability of mortality of large-diameter ponderosa pine from bark beetles and wood borers was directly related to surface fire severity and bole charring, which in turn depended on fire intensity, which was greater in units where thinning increased large woody fuels. These results have implications when deciding among management options for restoring ecosystem health in similar ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir forests.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70035739</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Davis, B.</author><author>Van Wagtendonk, J.W.</author><author>Beck, J.</author><author>Van Wagtendonk, K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeling Fuel Succession</title><secondary-title>Fire Management Today</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Fire Management Today</full-title></periodical><pages>18-21</pages><volume>69</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>fire behavior fuel models</keyword><keyword>surface fuels data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://svinet2.fs.fed.us/fire/fmt/fmt_pdfs/FMT69-2.pdf#page=18</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Leidolf, Andreas</author><author>Bissonette, John A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The effects of fire on avian communities: Spatio-temporal attributes of the literature 19122003</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</full-title></periodical><pages>609-622</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Disturbance</keyword><keyword>Fire effects</keyword><keyword>Fire ecology</keyword><keyword>Community ecology</keyword><keyword>Birds</keyword><keyword>Literature analysis.</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1049-8001</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1071/WF08019</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We reviewed the temporal, geographic, and biogeographic distribution, as well as relevant research and publication attributes, of 512 documents addressing the effects of fire on avian communities, to provide an assessment of the scope of this literature and recommendations for future research. We summarized relevant attributes of all documents to identify patterns that were then tested against appropriate null models. Most documents reported on original research, with the literature evenly divided between studies investigating controlled fire and those reporting on uncontrolled wildfires. Conceptual reviews made up the second largest category; methodological reviews, bibliographies, and meta-analyses were rare. Although the literature examined spans nearly a century, most documents were published within the last 15 years, with new literature being added at an increasing rate. However, increases seem to be skewed towards original research at the expense of synthesis. An overwhelming majority of documents were published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and in English. Other important publication outlets included MS and PhD theses and conference proceedings. The spatial distribution of documents by continent and biogeographic domain and division differed significantly from expectations based on land area. Future research on avian community response to fire should focus on (1) continued synthesis, emphasizing methodological reviews, bibliographies, and North America; (2) increasing research efforts in areas currently underrepresented in the literature, including Africa, Asia, and South and Central America; and (3) meta-analyses.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70036566</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Seiler, Ralph L</author><author>Wood, James L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sediment Loads and Yield, and Selected Water-Quality Parameters in Clear Creek, Carson City and Douglas County, Nevada, Water Years 2004-07</title></titles><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2009-5005</isbn><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20095005</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cannon, Susan H.</author><author>DeGraff, Jerry</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The increasing wildfire and post-fire debris-flow threat in western USA, and implications for consequences of climate change</title><secondary-title>Landslides - Disaster Risk Reduction</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Landslides - Disaster Risk Reduction</full-title></periodical><pages>177-190</pages><keywords><keyword>Climate change</keyword><keyword>Southern California</keyword><keyword>Debris flow</keyword><keyword>Hazards</keyword><keyword>Intermountain west USA</keyword><keyword>Risk</keyword><keyword>Western USA</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Springer</publisher><isbn>978-3-540-69966-8</isbn><abstract>In southern California and the intermountain west of the USA, debris flows generated from recently-burned basins pose significant hazards. Increases in the frequency and size of wildfires throughout the western USA can be attributed to increases in the number of fire ignitions, fire suppression practices, and climatic influences. Increased urbanization throughout the western USA, combined with the increased wildfire magnitude and frequency, carries with it the increased threat of subsequent debris-flow occurrence. Differences between rainfall thresholds and empirical debris-flow susceptibility models for southern California and the intermountain west indicate a strong influence of climatic and geologic settings on post-fire debris-flow potential. The linkages between wildfires, debris-flow occurrence, and global warming suggests that the experiences in the western United States are highly likely to be duplicated in many other parts of the world, and necessitate hazard assessment tools that are specific to local climates and physiographies. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84867232163&amp;partnerID=tZOtx3y1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vyas, Nimish B.</author><author>Spann, James W.</author><author>Hill, Elwood F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Acute oral toxicities of wildland fire control chemicals to birds</title><secondary-title>Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety</full-title></periodical><pages>862-865</pages><volume>72</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>American kestrel</keyword><keyword>Fire-Trol GTS-R™</keyword><keyword>Fire-Trol LCG-R™</keyword><keyword>Foams</keyword><keyword>Northern bobwhite</keyword><keyword>Phos-Chek D-75F™</keyword><keyword>Phos-Chek WD881™</keyword><keyword>Red-winged blackbird</keyword><keyword>Retardants</keyword><keyword>Silv-Ex™</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ecoenv.2008.09.001</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Wildland fire control chemicals are released into the environment by aerial and ground applications to manage rangeland, grassland, and forest fires.

Lightning ignitions, any of which could burn a large area given appropriate conditions for fire spread, could be the first indication of more frequent fire.We examined the relationship between snowpack and the ignition and size of fires that occurred in Yosemite National Park, California (area 3027km2), between 1984 and 2005. During this period, 1870 fires burned 77 718 ha. Decreased spring snowpack exponentially increased the number of lightning-ignited fires. Snowpack mediated lightning-ignited fires by decreasing the proportion of lightning strikes that caused lightning-ignited fires and through fewer lightning strikes in years with deep snowpack.We also quantified fire severity for the 103 fires &gt;40 ha with satellite fire-severity indices using 23 years of Landsat Thematic Mapper data. The proportion of the landscape that burned at higher severities and the complexity of higher-severity burn patches increased with the log10 of annual area burned. Using one snowpack forecast, we project that the number of lightning-ignited fires will increase 19.1% by 2020 to 2049 and the annual area burned at high severity will increase 21.9%. Climate-induced decreases in snowpack and the concomitant increase in fire severity suggest that existing assumptionsmay be understated – fires may become more frequent and more severe.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70035791</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lutz, J.

Large trees generally have lower rates of mortality than small trees and are more resilient to climate change, but these assumptions have rarely been examined in long-term studies. We combined data from 655 historical (1932-1936) and 210 modern (1988-1999) vegetation plots to examine changes in density of large-diameter trees in Yosemite National Park (3027 km2). We tested the assumption of stability for large-diameter trees, as both individual species and communities of large-diameter trees. Between the 1930s and 1990s, large-diameter tree density in Yosemite declined 24%. Although the decrease was apparent in all forest types, declines were greatest in subalpine and upper montane forests (57.0% of park area), and least in lower montane forests (15.3% of park area). Large-diameter tree densities of 11 species declined while only 3 species increased. Four general patterns emerged: (1) Pinus albicaulis, Quercus chrysolepis, and Quercus kelloggii had increases in density of large-diameter trees occur throughout their ranges; (2) Pinus jeffreyi, Pinus lambertiana, and Pinus ponderosa, had disproportionately larger decreases in large-diameter tree densities in lower-elevation portions of their ranges; (3) Abies concolor and Pinus contorta, had approximately uniform decreases in large-diameter trees throughout their elevational ranges; and (4) Abies magnifica, Calocedrus decurrens, Juniperus occidentalis, Pinus monticola, Pseudotsuga menziesii, and Tsuga mertensiana displayed little or no change in large-diameter tree densities. In Pinus ponderosa-Calocedrus decurrens forests, modern large-diameter tree densities were equivalent whether or not plots had burned since 1936. However, in unburned plots, the large-diameter trees were predominantly A. concolor, C. decurrens, and Q. chrysolepis, whereas P. ponderosa dominated the large-diameter component of burned plots. Densities of large-diameter P. ponderosa were 8.1 trees ha-1 in plots that had experienced fire, but only 0.5 trees ha-1 in plots that remained unburned. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

After documenting increased use of recently burned forests by boreal toads (Bufo boreas), we hypothesized that burned habitats provided improved thermal opportunities in terrestrial habitats. We tested this hypothesis by conducting a radio telemetry study of habitat use (reported previously) and by using physical models that simulated the temperature of adult toads. We deployed 108 physical models in and adjacent to a 1-year old burn using a fully-replicated design with three burn severities (unburned, partial, high severity) and four microhabitats (open surface, under vegetation, under log, in burrow). Model temperatures were compared to a range of preferred temperatures in published studies. We found 70% more observations within the preferred temperature range of B. boreas in forests burned with high severity than in unburned areas. Burned forest was warmer than unburned forest across all microhabitats, but the largest relative difference was in burrows, which averaged 3 °C warmer in high-severity burn areas and remained warmer though the night. More than twice as many observations were within the preferred temperature range in high-severity burrows than in unburned burrows. Areas burned with high severity were still warmer than unburned forest 3 years after the fire. Habitat use of toads during the concurrent radio telemetry study matched that predicted by the physical models. These results suggest there are fitness-linked benefits to toads using burned habitats, such as increased growth, fertility, and possibly disease resistance. However, increased soil temperatures that result from wildfire may be detrimental to other amphibian species that prefer cooler temperatures and stable environments. More broadly, our data illustrate the use of physical models to measure and interpret changes that amphibians may experience from disturbance, and highlight the need for research linking vital rates such as growth and survival to disturbance.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70036658</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shinneman, Douglas J.</author><author>Baker, William L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Historical fire and multidecadal drought as context for piñon - Juniper woodland restoration in western Colorado</title><secondary-title>Ecological Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>1231-1245</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Piñon-juniper woodland</keyword><keyword>Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation</keyword><keyword>Climate teleconnections</keyword><keyword>Disturbance dynamics</keyword><keyword>Ecological restoration</keyword><keyword>Juniperus osteosperma</keyword><keyword>Pacific Decadal Oscillation</keyword><keyword>Pinus edulis</keyword><keyword>Regeneration</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1051-0761</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1890/08-0846.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fire is known to structure tree populations, but the role of broad-scale climate variability is less clear. For example, the influence of climatic "teleconnections" (the relationship between oceanic-atmospheric fluctuations and anomalous weather patterns across broad scales) on forest age structure is relatively unexplored. We sampled semiarid piñon-juniper (Pinus edulis-Juniperus osteosperma) woodlands in western Colorado, U.S.A., to test the hypothesis that woodland age structures are shaped by climate, including links to oceanic-atmospheric fluctuations, and by past fires and livestock grazing. Low-severity surface fire was lacking, as fire scars were absent, and did not influence woodland densities, but stand-replacing fires served as long-rotation (&gt;400-600 years), stand-initiating events. Old-growth stands (&gt;300 years old) were found in 75% of plots, consistent with a long fire rotation. Juniper and piñon age structures suggest contrasting responses during the past several centuries to dry and wet episodes linked to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Juniper density increased slightly during periods of drought, positive (warm) AMO (after approximately 10-year lag), and negative (cool) PDO. In contrast, piñon populations may still be recovering from a long, drought-filled period (AD 1620-1820), with pulses of recovery favored during cool AMO, warm PDO, and above-average moisture periods. Analysis of 20th-century tree establishment and instrumental climate data corroborate the long-term relationships between age structure and climate. After Euro-American settlement (AD 1881), livestock grazing reduced understory grasses and forbs, reducing competition with tree seedlings and facilitating climate-induced increases in piñons. Thus tree populations in these woodlands are in flux, affected by drought and wet periods linked to oceanic-atmospheric variability, Euro-American livestock grazing, and long-rotation, high-severity fires. Reductions in livestock grazing levels may aid ecological restoration efforts. However, given long-term fluctuations in tree density and composition, and expected further drought, thinning or burning to reduce tree populations may be misdirected.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70036570</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Collins, Brandon M.</author><author>Miller, Jay D.</author><author>Thode, Andrea E.</author><author>Kelly, Maggi</author><author>Van Wagtendonk, Jan W.</author><author>Stephens, Scott L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interactions among wildland fires in a long-established Sierra Nevada natural fire area</title><secondary-title>Ecosystems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecosystems</full-title></periodical><pages>114-128</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire ecology</keyword><keyword>Fire management</keyword><keyword>Prescribed natural fire</keyword><keyword>Wildland fire use</keyword><keyword>Fire severity</keyword><keyword>Fire policy</keyword><keyword>Self-limiting</keyword><keyword>WFU</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1432-9840</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10021-008-9211-7</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We investigate interactions between successive naturally occurring fires, and assess to what extent the environments in which fires burn influence these interactions. Using mapped fire perimeters and satellite-based estimates of post-fire effects (referred to hereafter as fire severity) for 19 fires burning relatively freely over a 31-year period, we demonstrate that fire as a landscape process can exhibit self-limiting characteristics in an upper elevation Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forest. We use the term 'self-limiting' to refer to recurring fire as a process over time (that is, fire regime) consuming fuel and ultimately constraining the spatial extent and lessening fire-induced effects of subsequent fires. When the amount of time between successive adjacent fires is under 9 years, and when fire weather is not extreme (burning index &lt;34.9), the probability of the latter fire burning into the previous fire area is extremely low. Analysis of fire severity data by 10-year periods revealed a fair degree of stability in the proportion of area burned among fire severity classes (unchanged, low, moderate, high). This is in contrast to a recent study demonstrating increasing high-severity burning throughout the Sierra Nevada from 1984 to 2006, which suggests freely burning fires over time in upper elevation Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forests can regulate fire-induced effects across the landscape. This information can help managers better anticipate short-and long-term effects of allowing naturally ignited fires to burn, and ultimately, improve their ability to implement Wildland Fire Use programs in similar forest types.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70033094</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Mantgem, Phillip J.</author><author>Schwilk, Dylan W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Negligible influence of spatial autocorrelation in the assessment of fire effects in a mixed conifer forest</title><secondary-title>Fire Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Fire Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>116-125</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Prescribed fire</keyword><keyword>Sierra Nevada</keyword><keyword>Forest restoration</keyword><keyword>Pseudoreplication</keyword><keyword>Statistics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.4996/fireecology.0502116</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fire is an important feature of many forest ecosystems; although the quantification of its effects is compromised by the large scale at which fire occurs and its inherent unpredict- ability.

Shrubland ecosystems dominated by sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) and grassland ecosystems dominated by native perennial grasses (for example, Hilaria jamesii and Sporabolis sp.) are high-priority conservation targets for the Federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and other resource managers because of their diversity, productivity, and vital importance as wildlife habitat. These ecosystems have been recognized as imperiled on a regional scale since at least the mid-1990s due to habitat loss (type conversions), land-use practices, and invasive exotic plants (Noss and others, 1995). In the Intermountain West, the exotic annual cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is recognized as one of the most pervasive and serious threats to the health of native sagebrush and grassland ecosystems through effects on fire regimes and resource conditions experienced by native species (Billings, 1990; Norton and others, 2004).\nManagers require information concerning patterns and underlying mechanisms of exotic plant invasion to support monitoring, restoration, and other management actions that may be necessary for sustaining the native diversity and productivity of sagebrush and grassland ecosystems. In the Canyon Rims area of San Juan County, Utah, grassland sites located in the midst of sagebrush-dominated landscapes are commonly infested with dense populations of cheatgrass or other exotic annual plants such as stork's bill (Erodium cicutarium). Recent observations suggest that soil properties may play a significant role in shaping distributional patterns of sagebrush and\n2\nweed-infested grasslands in the Canyon Rims area, and that patterns in critical soil properties may be controlled by geomorphic processes and predicted on the basis of landscape attributes.</abstract><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2009/1219/pdf/OF09-1219.pdf</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fellers, Gary M</author><author>Osbourn, Michael S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fire Effects on the Point Reyes Mountain Beaver (Aplodontia rufa phaea) at Point Reyes National Seashore, 10 Years After the Vision Fire</title><secondary-title>Northwestern Naturalist</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Northwestern Naturalist</full-title></periodical><pages>189-193</pages><volume>90</volume><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1898/NWN08-08.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Abstract The 1995 Vision Fire burned 5000 ha and destroyed 40% of the habitat of the Point Reyes Mountain Beaver (Aplodontia rufa phaea). Surveys immediately post-fire and in 2000 showed that only 0.4 to 1.7% of Mountain Beavers within the burn area survived. In 2000, dense, ground-hugging Blue-blossom Ceanothus (Ceanothus thrysiflorus) appeared to make coastal scrub thickets much less suitable for Mountain Beavers even though the number of burrows at our 11 study sites had returned to 88% of pre-fire numbers. In 2005 (10 y post-fire), the habitat appeared to be better for Mountain Beavers; Blue-blossom Ceanothus had diminished and vegetation more typical of northern coastal scrub, such as Coyote Brush (Baccharis pilularis) overstory with a lower layer of herbaceous vegetation, had greatly increased; but the number of Mountain Beaver burrows had declined to 52% of pre-fire numbers and there was little change in the number of sites occupied between our 2000 and 2005 surveys. With the expected successional changes in thicket structure, Mountain Beaver populations are likely to recover further, but there will probably be considerable variation in how each population stabilizes.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1898/NWN08-08.1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author><author>Zedler, Paul H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Large, high-intensity fire events in Southern California shrublands: Debunking the fine-grain age patch model</title><secondary-title>Ecological Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>69-94</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire history</keyword><keyword>Megafires</keyword><keyword>19th century</keyword><keyword>Baja California</keyword><keyword>Chaparral</keyword><keyword>Fine-grain age patch mosaic</keyword><keyword>High-intensity fires</keyword><keyword>Sage scrub</keyword><keyword>Santa Ana winds</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1051-0761</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1890/08-0281.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We evaluate the fine-grain age patch model of. re regimes in southern California shrublands. Proponents contend that the historical condition was characterized by frequent small to moderate size, slow-moving smoldering fires, and that this regime has been disrupted by fire suppression activities that have caused unnatural fuel accumulation and anomalously large and catastrophic wild fires. A review of more than 100 19th-century newspaper reports reveals that large, high-intensity wild. res predate modern fire suppression policy, and extensive newspaper coverage plus first-hand accounts support the conclusion that the 1889 Santiago Canyon Fire was the largest fire in California history. Proponents of the fine-grain age patch model contend that even the very earliest 20th-century fires were the result of. re suppression disrupting natural fuel structure. We tested that hypothesis and found that, within the fire perimeters of two of the largest early fire events in 1919 and 1932, prior. re suppression activities were insufficient to have altered the natural fuel structure. Over the last 130 years there has been no significant change in the incidence of large fires greater than 10 000 ha, consistent with the conclusion that fire suppression activities are not the cause of these. re events. Eight megafires (&gt;= 50 000 ha) are recorded for the region, and half have occurred in the last five years. These burned through a mosaic of age classes, which raises doubts that accumulation of old age classes explains these events. Extreme drought is a plausible explanation for this recent rash of such events, and it is hypothesized that these are due to droughts that led to increased dead fine fuels that promoted the incidence of firebrands and spot fires. A major shortcoming of the fine-grain age patch model is that it requires age-dependent flammability of shrubland fuels, but seral stage chaparral is dominated by short-lived species that create a dense surface layer of fie fuels. Results from the Behave Plus. re model with a custom fuel module for young chaparral shows that there is sufficient dead fuel to spread fire even under relatively little winds. Empirical studies of fuel ages burned in recent. res illustrate that young fuels often comprise a major portion of burned vegetation, and there is no difference between evergreen chaparral and semi-deciduous sage scrub. It has also been argued that the present-day fire size distribution in northern Baja California is a model of the historical patterns that were present on southern California landscapes. Applying this model with historical fire frequencies shows that the Baja model is inadequate to maintain these fire-prone ecosystems and further demonstrates that fire managers in southern California are not likely to learn much from studying modern Baja California. re regimes. Further supporting this conclusion are theoretical cellular automata models of. re spread, which show that, even in systems with age dependent flammability, landscapes evolve toward a complex age mosaic with a plausible age structure only when there is a severe stopping rule that constrains fire size, and only if ignitions are saturating.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70035827</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Grant, Todd A.</author><author>Flanders-Wanner, Bridgette</author><author>Shaffer, Terry L.</author><author>Murphy, Robert K.</author><author>Knutsen, Gregg A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An emerging crisis across northern prairie refuges: Prevalence of invasive plants and a plan for adaptive management</title><secondary-title>Ecological Restoration</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Restoration</full-title></periodical><pages>58-65</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Restoration</keyword><keyword>Invasive species</keyword><keyword>Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis)</keyword><keyword>Mixed-grass prairie</keyword><keyword>Smooth brome (Bromus inermis)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3368/er.27.1.58</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In the northern Great Plains, native prairies managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) can be pivotal in conservation of North America's biological diversity. From 2002 to 2006, we surveyed 7,338 belt transects to assess the general composition of mixed-grass and tallgrass prairie vegetation across five "complexes" (i.e., administrative groupings) of national wildlife refuges managed by the Service in North Dakota and South Dakota. Native grasses and forbs were common (mean frequency of occurrence 47%-54%) on two complexes but uncommon (4%-13%) on two others. Conversely, an introduced species of grass, smooth brome (Bromus inermis), accounted for 45% to 49% of vegetation on two complexes and another species, Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis) accounted for 27% to 36% of the vegetation on three of the complexes. Our data confirm prior suspicions of widespread invasion by introduced species of plants on Service-owned tracts of native prairie, changes that likely stem in part from a common management history of little or no disturbance (e.g., defoliation by grazing or fire). However, variability in the degree and type of invasion among prairie tracts suggests that knowledge of underlying causes (e.g., edaphic or climatic factors, management histories) could help managers more effectively restore prairies. We describe an adaptive management approach to acquire such knowledge while progressing with restoration. More specifically, we propose to use data from inventories of plant communities on Service-owned prairies to design and implement, as experiments, optimal restoration strategies. We will then monitor these experiments and use the results to refine future strategies. This comprehensive, process-oriented approach should yield reliable and robust recommendations for restoration and maintenance of native prairies in the northern Great Plains.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70035796</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Woodruff, Laurel G.</author><author>Sandheinrich, Mark B.</author><author>Brigham, Mark E.</author><author>WF, Cannon</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of Wildfire on Levels of Mercury in Forested Watershed Systems — Voyageurs National Park , Minnesota</title></titles><pages>1-61</pages><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2009-5151</isbn><abstract>Scientific Investigations Report 2009–5151</abstract><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2009/5151/</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Waitman, Benjamin A.</author><author>Draper, Trent M.</author><author>Esque, Todd C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The effects of seeding sterile triticale on a native plant community after wildfire in a pinyon pinemountain mahogany woodland</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</full-title></periodical><pages>659-664</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Rehabilitation</keyword><keyword>Cercocarpus ledifolius var. intermontanus</keyword><keyword>Mitigation measures</keyword><keyword>Pinus monophyla</keyword><keyword>Spring Mountains National Recreational Area</keyword><keyword>Triticosecale.</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1049-8001</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1071/WF07157</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Post-fire seeding with grasses is a common practice for emergency rehabilitation of burned woodlands. However, most post-seeding monitoring does not address consequences to native flora. In November 2004, the US Forest Service hand-seeded triticale (×Triticosecale Wittm. ex A. Camus), a sterile wheat–rye hybrid, on a small burned area in the Spring Mountains of southern Nevada, United States. A monitoring project using paired plots was designed to quantify the effects of seeding triticale on density and species richness of native annual and perennial plants, cover of perennial plants, and aboveground production of annual plants. We did not find any effects of triticale seeding on annual plant species or most responses of perennial plants. However, the density of woody perennial seedlings was significantly lower 2 years after triticale was added. Although we found a smaller impact from seeding with exotic grass than other studies, quantifiable costs to native vegetation were observed. We caution against the use of non-native grass for seeding in areas with naturally low perennial recruitment.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70035819</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Harden, JW</author><author>Munster, J.</author><author>Manies, KL</author><author>Mack, MC</author><author>Bubier, JL</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Changes in Species, Areal Cover, and Production of Moss across a Fire Chronosequence in Interior Alaska</title></titles><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2009-1208</isbn><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.lter.uaf.edu/pdf/1475_Harden_Munster_2009.pdf</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cole, Christopher</author><author>Lile, Elizabeth</author><author>Briggs, Jennifer</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hazards Management in Grand County, Colorado-Fire Fuels Characterization</title></titles><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2008-3078</isbn><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/fs20083078</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author><author>Safford, Hugh D.</author><author>Fotheringham, C.

We use the 2007 fires as a case study to draw three major lessons about wildfires and wildfire complexity in southern California. First, the great majority of large fires in southern California occur in the autumn under the influence of Santa Ana windstorms. These fires also cost the most to contain and cause the most damage to life and property, and the October 2007 fires were no exception because thousands of homes were lost and seven people were killed. Being pushed by wind gusts over 100 kph, young fuels presented little barrier to their spread as the 2007 fires reburned considerable portions of the area burned in the historic 2003 fire season. Adding to the size of these fires was the historic 2006–2007 drought that contributed to high dead fuel loads and long distance spotting. As in 2003, young chaparral stands and fuel treatments were not reliable barriers to fire in October 2007. Second, the Zaca Fire in July and August 2007 showed that other factors besides high winds can sometimes combine to create conditions for large fires in southern California. Spring and summer fires in southern California chaparral are usually easily contained because of higher fuel moisture and the general lack of high winds. However, the Zaca Fire burned in a remote wilderness area of rugged terrain that made access difficult. In addition, because of its remoteness, anthropogenic ignitions have been low and stand age and fuel loads were high. Coupled with this was severe drought that year that generated fuel moisture levels considerably below normal for early summer. A third lesson comes from 2007 conifer forest fires in the southern California mountains. In contrast to lower elevation chaparral, fire suppression has led to major increases in conifer forest fuels that can lead to unnaturally severe fires when ignitions escape control. The Slide and Grass Valley Fires of October 2007 occurred in forests that had been subject to extensive fuel treatment, but fire control was complicated by a patchwork of untreated private properties and mountain homes built of highly flammable materials. In a fashion reminiscent of other recent destructive conifer fires in California, burning homes themselves were a major source of fire spread. These lessons suggest that the most important advances in fire safety in this region are to come from advances in fire prevention, fire preparedness, and land-use planning that includes fire hazard patterns</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70036938</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Carswell Jr., William J</author><author>Newell, Mark R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hazards, Disasters, and The National Map</title></titles><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2009-3010</isbn><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/fs20093010</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Carr, Timothy R.</author><author>Iqbal, Asif</author><author>Callaghan, Nick</author><author>Dana-Adkins-Heljeson</author><author>Look, Kurt</author><author>Saving, Shawn</author><author>Nelson, Ken</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A national look at carbon capture and storage-National carbon sequestration database and geographical information system (NatCarb)</title><secondary-title>Energy Procedia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Energy Procedia</full-title></periodical><pages>2841-2847</pages><volume>1</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Geospatial</keyword><keyword>National carbon cyberinfrastructure</keyword><keyword>Sinks</keyword><keyword>Sources</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1876-6102</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.egypro.2009.02.057</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The US Department of Energy's Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships (RCSPs) are responsible for generating geospatial data for the maps displayed in the Carbon Sequestration Atlas of the United States and Canada. Key geospatial data (carbon sources, potential storage sites, transportation, land use, etc.) are required for the Atlas, and for efficient implementation of carbon sequestration on a national and regional scale. The National Carbon Sequestration Database and Geographical Information System (NatCarb) is a relational database and geographic information system (GIS) that integrates carbon storage data generated and maintained by the RCSPs and various other sources. The purpose of NatCarb is to provide a national view of the carbon capture and storage potential in the U.S. and Canada. The digital spatial database allows users to estimate the amount of CO2emitted by sources (such as power plants, refineries and other fossil-fuel-consuming industries) in relation to geologic formations that can provide safe, secure storage sites over long periods of time. The NatCarb project is working to provide all stakeholders with improved online tools for the display and analysis of CO2carbon capture and storage data. NatCarb is organizing and enhancing the critical information about CO2sources and developing the technology needed to access, query, model, analyze, display, and distribute natural resource data related to carbon management. Data are generated, maintained and enhanced locally at the RCSP level, or at specialized data warehouses, and assembled, accessed, and analyzed in real-time through a single geoportal. NatCarb is a functional demonstration of distributed data-management systems that cross the boundaries between institutions and geographic areas. It forms the first step toward a functioning National Carbon Cyberinfrastructure (NCCI). NatCarb provides access to first-order information to evaluate the costs, economic potential and societal issues of CO2capture and storage, including public perception and regulatory aspects. NatCarb online access has been modified to address the broad needs of a spectrum of users. NatCarb includes not only GIS and database query tools for high-end user, but simplified display for the general public using readily available web tools such as Google Earth™and Google Maps™.

In the western Arctic, under four scenarios of future climate change and future fire regimes (2003&amp;8211;2100), we examined changes in surface albedo and the related changes in regional atmospheric heating due to: (1) vegetation changes following a changing fire regime, and (2) changes in snow cover duration. We used a spatially explicit dynamic vegetation model (Alaskan Frame-based Ecosystem Code) to simulate changes in successional dynamics associated with fire under the future climate scenarios, and the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model to simulate changes in snow cover. Changes in summer heating due to the changes in the forest stand age distributions under future fire regimes showed a slight cooling effect due to increases in summer albedo (mean across climates of &amp;8722;0.9 W m&amp;8722;2 decade&amp;8722;1). Over this same time period, decreases in snow cover (mean reduction in the snow season of 4.5 d decade&amp;8722;1) caused a reduction in albedo, and a heating effect (mean across climates of 4.3 W m&amp;8722;2 decade&amp;8722;1). Adding both the summer negative change in atmospheric heating due to changes in fire regimes to the positive changes in atmospheric heating due to changes in the length of the snow season resulted in a 3.4 W m&amp;8722;2 decade&amp;8722;1 increase in atmospheric heating. These findings highlight the importance of gaining a better understanding of the influences of changes in surface albedo on atmospheric heating due to both changes in the fire regime and changes in snow cover duration.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70168802</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Xuexia</author><author>Ohlen, Donald O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Use of multi-temporal Landsat images to monitor forest disturbance (1987-2007) in the Black Hills of South Dakota</title></titles><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>9781618391940</isbn><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70157238</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lorimer, Craig G.</author><author>Porter, Daniel J.</author><author>Madej, Mary Ann</author><author>Stuart, John D.</author><author>Veirs, Stephen D.</author><author>Norman, Steven P.</author><author>O'Hara, Kevin L.</author><author>Libby, William J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Presettlement and modern disturbance regimes in coast redwood forests: Implications for the conservation of old-growth stands</title><secondary-title>Forest Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forest Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>1038-1054</pages><volume>258</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire regimes</keyword><keyword>Windstorms</keyword><keyword>Fire suppression</keyword><keyword>Age structure</keyword><keyword>Flooding</keyword><keyword>Forest succession</keyword><keyword>Gap dynamics</keyword><keyword>Sequoia sempervirens</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0378-1127</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.foreco.2009.07.008</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), a western North American conifer of ancient lineage, has a paradoxical combination of late-successional characteristics and strong adaptations to disturbance. Despite its shade tolerance and heavy dominance of the canopy on many sites, redwood saplings are uncommon in upland old-growth stands. Information needed to ensure the conservation of old-growth redwood forests has been limited. In this review paper, we integrate evidence on redwood biology with data on the historic and modern disturbance regimes to help clarify the degree to which key attributes of redwood forests may have been dependent upon periodic disturbance. Available evidence suggests that episodes of fire, flooding, and slope failure prior to European settlement were frequent but predominantly of low to moderate severity and extent, resulting in broadly uneven-aged forests. The majority of fires prior to European settlement were apparently of human origin. Frequency and severity of the major disturbance agents have been radically changed in modern times. Fires have been largely excluded, and flooding has been altered in ways that have often been detrimental to old-growth redwoods on alluvial terraces. However, because of the apparent anthropogenic origin of most presettlement fires, the long-term evolutionary role of fire for coast redwood is ecologically ambiguous. With fire exclusion, redwood possibly could be displaced to some extent on upland sites by increasing abundance of fire-sensitive competitors. Alternatively, redwood may be able to maintain dominance by vegetative sprouting and new seedling establishment on root-wad mounds, fallen logs, and on soil exposed by slope failure. Future research priorities are suggested that will help resolve some of the current ambiguities. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70179505</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Van Mantgem, Phillip J.</author><author>Stephenson, Nathan L.</author><author>Byrne, John C.</author><author>Daniels, Lori D.</author><author>Franklin, Jerry F.</author><author>Fulé, Peter Z.</author><author>Harmon, Mark E.</author><author>Larson, Andrew J.</author><author>Smith, Jeremy M.</author><author>Taylor, Alan H.</author><author>Veblen, Thomas T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Widespread increase of tree mortality rates in the Western United States</title><secondary-title>Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science</full-title></periodical><pages>521-524</pages><volume>323</volume><issue>5913</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0036-8075</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.1165000</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Persistent changes in tree mortality rates can alter forest structure, composition, and ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration. Our analyses of longitudinal data from unmanaged old forests in the western United States showed that background (noncatastrophic) mortality rates have increased rapidly in recent decades, with doubling periods ranging from 17 to 29 years among regions. Increases were also pervasive across elevations, tree sizes, dominant genera, and past fire histories. Forest density and basal area declined slightly, which suggests that increasing mortality was not caused by endogenous increases in competition. Because mortality increased in small trees, the overall increase in mortality rates cannot be attributed solely to aging of large trees. Regional warming and consequent increases in water deficits are likely contributors to the increases in tree mortality rates.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70033202</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Halsey, Rw</author><author>Keeley, Je</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fuel Age and Fire Spread: Natural Conditions Versus Opportunities for Fire Suppression</title><secondary-title>Fire Management Today</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Fire Management Today</full-title></periodical><pages>22-28</pages><volume>69</volume><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>W ildfires are driven and restrained by an interplay of variables that can lead to many potential outcomes.

Identifying the impacts of prescribed fire on bird communities in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests is necessary for providing land management agencies with information regarding the effects of fuel reduction on sensitive, threatened, and migratory bird species Recent developments in occupancy modeling have established a framework for quantifying the impacts of management practices on wildlife community dynamics. We describe a Bayesian hierarchical model of multi-species occupancy accounting for detection probability, and we demonstrate the model's usefulness for identifying effects of habitat disturbances on wildlife communities. Advantages to using the model include the ability to estimate the effects of environmental impacts on rare or elusive species, the intuitive nature of the modeling, the incorporation of detection probability, the estimation of parameter uncertainty, the flexibility of the model to suit a variety of experimental designs, and the composite estimate of the response that applies to the collection of observed species as opposed to merely a small subset of common species. Our modeling of the impacts of prescribed fire on avian communities in a ponderosa pine forest in Washington indicate that prescribed fire treatments result in increased occupancy rates for several bark-insectivore, cavity-nesting species including a management species of interest, Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus). Three aerial insectivore species, and the ground insectivore, American Robin (Turdus migratorius), also responded positively to prescribed fire, whereas three foliage insectivores and two seed specialists, Clark's Nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana) and the Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus), declined following treatments. Land management agencies interested in determining the effects of habitat manipulations on wildlife communities can use these methods to provide guidance for future management activities.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70036624</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Preisler, Haiganoush K.</author><author>Burgan, Robert E.</author><author>Eidenshink, Jeffery C.</author><author>Klaver, Jacqueline M.</author><author>Klaver, Robert W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Forecasting distributions of large federal-lands fires utilizing satellite and gridded weather information</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</full-title></periodical><pages>508-516</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire business</keyword><keyword>Fire danger</keyword><keyword>Fire distribution</keyword><keyword>Fire mapping</keyword><keyword>Fire occurrence</keyword><keyword>Semi-parametric logistic regression</keyword><keyword>Spatial mapping</keyword><keyword>Statistical comparisons of fire danger indices.</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1071/WF08032</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The current study presents a statistical model for assessing the skill of fire danger indices and for forecasting the distribution of the expected numbers of large fires over a given region and for the upcoming week.

Old-growth and open shrub savanna woodlands have been present over much of the last several hundred years. Strong evidence indicates these woodlands have experienced significant tree infilling and major expansion in their distribution since the late 1800s by encroaching into surrounding landscapes once dominated by shrubs and herbaceous vegetation. Both infilling and expansion affects soil resources, plant community structure and composition, water and nutrient cycles, forage production, wildlife habitat, biodiversity, and fire patterns across the landscape. Another impact is the shift from historic fire regimes to larger and more intense wildfires that are increasingly determining the future of this landscape. This publication helps biologists and land managers consider how to look at expansion of woodlands and determine what questions to ask to develop a management strategy, including prescribed fire or other practices.</abstract><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://purl.access.gpo.gov/GPO/LPS115188%5Cnhttp://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/1335/%5Cnhttp://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/1335/circ1335.pdf</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Archuleta, Christy-Ann M</author><author>Eames, Deanna R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Web application to access U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works and Restoration Projects information for the Rio Grande Basin, southern Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas</title></titles><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2009-3104</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/fs20093104</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Balouet, Jean Christophe</author><author>Smith, Kevin T.</author><author>Vroblesky, Don</author><author>Oudijk, Gil</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Use of dendrochronology and dendrochemistry in environmental forensics: Does it meet the Daubert criteria?</title><secondary-title>Environmental Forensics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Forensics</full-title></periodical><pages>268-276</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Daubert criteria</keyword><keyword>Dendrochemistry</keyword><keyword>Dendrochronology</keyword><keyword>Dendroecology</keyword><keyword>Forensics</keyword><keyword>Tree-rings</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1527-5922</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/15275920903347545</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Dendrochronological methods have been in use for more than 100 years, providing us a record of climate, human activities (archaeology), floods, fire, mudslides and other geological and biological events. More recently, dendrochemisty has been used to assess the time frames of the onset and existence of environmental contamination. This article assesses the scientific status of dendrochronology and dendrochemistry with respect to the admissibility of expert testimony and Daubert legal criteria. The purpose of this article is to identify the crucial scientific aspects of dendrochronology and dendrochemistry that address the Daubert criteria and Rule 702 as amended in 2000. To clarify terminology, dendrochronology is the precise and reliable assignment of the year of formation of tree rings. Dendroecology is the use of dendrochronology to understand ecological and environmental processes (Schweingruber, 1996). Dendrochemistry is a subdiscipline of dendrochronology that analyzes and interprets the wood chemistry of precisely dated tree rings. Forensic dendrochemistry applies dendrochemistry to resolve environmental disputes and generally deal with questions regarding the timing and/or the source of environmental incidents. One significant application of forensic dendrochemistry to expert testimony is to address issues of anthropogenic contamination. Forensic dendroecology is a similar term to forensic dendrochemistry, but forensic dendrochemistry will be used in this discussion as the latter term emphasizes the use of chemical detection methods. Because dendrochemistry is based on the foundation of dendrochronology, both the former specialty and the latter broader discipline will be discussed.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70037496</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Knutson, K C</author><author>Pyke, D A</author><author>Wirth, T A</author><author>Pilliod, D S</author><author>Brooks, M L</author><author>Chambers, J C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Chronosequence Feasibility Assessment of Emergency Fire Rehabilitation Records within the Intermountain Western United States – Final Report to the Joint Fire Science Program.

The effects of these activities have been most pronounced in seasonally dry, low and mid-elevation coniferous forests that once experienced frequent, low to moderate intensity, fire regimes. In this paper, we report the effects of Fire and Fire Surrogate (FFS) forest stand treatments on fuel load profiles, potential fire behavior, and fire severity under three weather scenarios from six western U.S. FFS sites. This replicated, multisite experiment provides a framework for drawing broad generalizations about the effectiveness of prescribed fire and mechanical treatments on surface fuel loads, forest structure, and potential fire severity. Mechanical treatments without fire resulted in combined 1-, 10-, and 100-hour surface fuel loads that were significantly greater than controls at three of five FFS sites. Canopy cover was significantly lower than controls at three of five FFS sites with mechanical-only treatments and at all five FFS sites with the mechanical plus burning treatment; fire-only treatments reduced canopy cover at only one site. For the combined treatment of mechanical plus fire, all five FFS sites with this treatment had a substantially lower likelihood of passive crown fire as indicated by the very high torching indices. FFS sites that experienced significant increases in 1-, 10-, and 100-hour combined surface fuel loads utilized harvest systems that left all activity fuels within experimental units. When mechanical treatments were followed by prescribed burning or pile burning, they were the most effective treatment for reducing crown fire potential and predicted tree mortality because of low surface fuel loads and increased vertical and horizontal canopy separation. Results indicate that mechanical plus fire, fire-only, and mechanical-only treatments using whole-tree harvest systems were all effective at reducing potential fire severity under severe fire weather conditions. Retaining the largest trees within stands also increased fire resistance.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70035714</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pyke, David A</author><author>Pilliod, David S</author><author>Chambers, Jeanne C</author><author>Brooks, Matthew L</author><author>Grace, James</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fire rehabilitation effectiveness: a chronosequence approach for the Great Basin</title></titles><pages>34-34</pages><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70058740</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fleming, Genie M.</author><author>Diffendorfer, James E.</author><author>Zedler, Paul H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The relative importance of disturbance and exotic-plant abundance in California coastal sage scrub</title><secondary-title>Ecological Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>2210-2227</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire</keyword><keyword>Grazing</keyword><keyword>Agriculture</keyword><keyword>Camp pendleton, california, USA</keyword><keyword>Coastal sage scrub</keyword><keyword>Exotic plants</keyword><keyword>Long Term Ecological Trend Monitoring Program</keyword><keyword>Mechanical disturbance</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1051-0761</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1890/07-1959.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Many ecosystems of conservation concern require some level of disturbance to sustain their species composition and ecological function. However, inappropriate disturbance regimes could favor invasion or expansion of exotic species. In southern California coastal sage scrub (CSS) fire is a natural disturbance, but because of human influence, frequencies may now be unnaturally high. Other anthropogenic disturbances such as grazing also occur in reserve areas. Managers charged with imposing or tolerating fire or other disturbance within their reserves are concerned that habitat quality may be degraded by an increasing abundance of exotic plants. We used vegetation monitoring data from Camp Pendleton, California, USA, to assess the correlation between past disturbances (frequent fire, agriculture, or grazing and mechanical disturbances) and current exotic species abundance in CSS. We found that disturbance history was only modestly related to exotic abundance overall, but fire frequency showed the strongest association. We also examined whether cover and richness of various native plant life forms (woody species, perennial herbs, and annual herbs) were more strongly influenced by disturbance history or by exotic-plant abundance. Native plant responses varied among life forms, but woody species and annual herbs were generally more strongly and negatively associated with exotic abundance than with disturbance. Effective CSS conservation will require developing means to curb the negative impacts of exotic plants, which may abound with or without severe or recent disturbance. Additionally, more focus should be given to understory herbs showing sensitivity to invasion. Though understudied, native herbs comprise the greatest portion of plant diversity in CSS and are critical to preservation of the community as a whole.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70037157</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Balshi, Michael S.</author><author>Mcguire, A.

Across this region, wildfires influence the temporal and spatial dynamics of carbon storage. In this study, we estimate fire emissions and changes in carbon storage for boreal North America over the 21st century. We use a gridded data set developed with a multivariate adaptive regression spline approach to determine how area burned varies each year with changing climatic and fuel moisture conditions.We apply the process-based Terrestrial Ecosystem Model to evaluate the role of future fire on the carbon dynamics of boreal North America in the context of changing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and climate in the A2 and B2 emissions scenarios of the CGCM2 global climate model. Relative to the last decade of the 20th century, decadal total carbon emissions from fire increase by 2.5–4.4 times by 2091–2100, depending on the climate scenario and assumptions about CO2 fertilization. Larger fire emissions occur with warmer climates or if CO2 fertilization is assumed to occur. Despite the increases in fire emissions, our simulations indicate that boreal North America will be a carbon sink over the 21st century if CO2 fertilization is assumed to occur in the future. In contrast, simulations excluding CO2 fertilization over the same period indicate that the region will change to a carbon source to the atmosphere, with the source being 2.1 times greater under the warmer A2 scenario than the B2 scenario. To improve estimates of wildfire on terrestrial carbon dynamics in boreal North America, future studies should incorporate the role of dynamic vegetation to represent more accurately post-fire successional processes, incorporate fire severity parameters that change in time and space, account for human influences through increased fire suppres- sion, and integrate the role of other disturbances and their interactions with future fire regime.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70035083</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shevliakova, Elena</author><author>Pacala, Stephen W.</author><author>Malyshev, Sergey</author><author>Hurtt, George C.</author><author>Milly, P.

LM3V is specifically designed to address the consequences of land use and land management changes including cropland and pasture dynamics, shifting cultivation, logging, fire, and resulting patterns of secondary regrowth. Here we analyze the behavior of LM3V, forced with the output from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) atmospheric model AM2, observed precipitation data, and four historic scenarios of land use change for 1700--2000. Our analysis suggests a net terrestrial carbon source due to land use activities from 1.1 to 1.3 GtC/a during the 1990s, where the range is due to the difference in the historic cropland distribution. This magnitude is substantially smaller than previous estimates from other models, largely due to our estimates of a secondary vegetation sink of 0.35 to 0.6 GtC/a in the 1990s and decelerating agricultural land clearing since the 1960s. For the 1990s, our estimates for the pastures' carbon flux vary from a source of 0.37 to a sink of 0.15 GtC/a, and for the croplands our model shows a carbon source of 0.6 to 0.9 GtC/a. Our process-based model suggests a smaller net deforestation source than earlier bookkeeping models because it accounts for decelerated net conversion of primary forest to agriculture and for stronger secondary vegetation regrowth in tropical regions. The overall uncertainty is likely to be higher than the range reported here because of uncertainty in the biomass recovery under changing ambient conditions, including atmospheric CO2 concentration, nutrients availability, and climate.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70034446</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fire intensity, fire severity and burn severity: A brief review and suggested usage</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</full-title></periodical><pages>116-126</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>BAER</keyword><keyword>DNBR Landsat Thematic Mapper</keyword><keyword>Soil burn severity.</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1049-8001</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1071/WF07049</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Several recent papers have suggested replacing the terminology of fire intensity and fire severity. Part of the problem with fire intensity is that it is sometimes used incorrectly to describe fire effects, when in fact it is justifiably restricted to measures of energy output. Increasingly, the term has created confusion because some authors have restricted its usage to a single measure of energy output referred to as fireline intensity. This metric is most useful in understanding fire behavior in forests, but is too narrow to fully capture the multitude of ways fire energy affects ecosystems. Fire intensity represents the energy released during various phases of a fire, and different metrics such as reaction intensity, fireline intensity, temperature, heating duration and radiant energy are useful for different purposes. Fire severity, and the related term burn severity, have created considerable confusion because of recent changes in their usage. Some authors have justified this by contending that fire severity is defined broadly as ecosystem impacts from fire and thus is open to individual interpretation. However, empirical studies have defined fire severity operationally as the loss of or change in organic matter aboveground and belowground, although the precise metric varies with management needs. Confusion arises because fire or burn severity is sometimes defined so that it also includes ecosystem responses. Ecosystem responses include soil erosion, vegetation regeneration, restoration of community structure, faunal recolonization, and a plethora of related response variables. Although some ecosystem responses are correlated with measures of fire or burn severity, many important ecosystem processes have either not been demonstrated to be predicted by severity indices or have been shown in some vegetation types to be unrelated to severity. This is a critical issue because fire or burn severity are readily measurable parameters, both on the ground and with remote sensing, yet ecosystem responses are of most interest to resource managers.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032718</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Doerr, S.

This is viewed by many as one of the main causes for accelerated post-fire runoff and soil erosion and it has often been assumed that strong soil water repellency present after wildfire is fire-induced. However, high levels of repellency have also been reported under vegetation types not affected by fire, and the question arises to what degree the water repellency observed at burnt sites actually results from fire. This study aimed at determining 'natural background' water repellency in common coniferous forest types in the north-western USA. Mature or semi-mature coniferous forest sites (n = 81), which showed no evidence of recent fires and had at least some needle cast cover, were sampled across six states. After careful removal of litter and duff at each site, soil water repellency was examined in situ at the mineral soil surface using the Water Drop Penetration Time (WDPT) method for three sub-sites, followed by collecting near-surface mineral soil layer samples (0-3 cm depth). Following air-drying, samples were further analyzed for repellency using WDPT and contact angle (θsl) measurements. Amongst other variables examined were dominant tree type, ground vegetation, litter and duff layer depth, slope angle and aspect, elevation, geology, and soil texture, organic carbon content and pH. 'Natural background' water repellency (WDPT &gt; 5 s) was detected in situ and on air-dry samples at 75% of all sites examined irrespective of dominant tree species (Pinus ponderosa, Pinus contorta, Picea engelmanii and Pseudotsuga menziesii). These findings demonstrate that the soil water repellency commonly observed in these forest types following burning is not necessarily the result of recent fire but can instead be a natural characteristic. The notion of a low background water repellency being typical for long-unburnt conifer forest soils of the north-western USA is therefore incorrect. It follows that, where pre-fire water repellency levels are not known or highly variable, post-fire soil water repellency conditions are an unreliable indicator in classifying soil burn severity. The terrain and soil variables examined showed, overall, no convincing relationship with the repellency levels observed (R2 &lt; 0.15) except that repellency was limited in soils (i) developed over meta-sedimentary lithology and (ii) with clay contents &gt;4%. This suggests that water repellency levels cannot be predicted with confidence from common terrain or soil variables. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70035011</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Graham, John H.</author><author>Krzysik, Anthony J.</author><author>Kovacic, David A.</author><author>Duda, Jeffrey J.</author><author>Freeman, D.

Ant communities in the southeastern United States displayed a hump-backed species richness curve against an index of landscape disturbance. Forty sites at Fort Benning, in west-central Georgia, covered a spectrum of habitat disturbance (military training and fire) in upland forest. Sites disturbed by military training had fewer trees, less canopy cover, more bare ground, and warmer, more compact soils with shallower A-horizons. We sampled ground-dwelling ants with pitfall traps, and measured 15 habitat variables related to vegetation and soil. Ant species richness was greatest with a relative disturbance of 43%, but equitability was greatest with no disturbance. Ant abundance was greatest with a relative disturbance of 85%. High species richness at intermediate disturbance was associated with greater within-site spatial heterogeneity. Species richness was also associated with intermediate values of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a correlate of net primary productivity (NPP). Available NPP (the product of NDVI and the fraction of days that soil temperature exceeded 25 °C), however, was positively correlated with species richness, though not with ant abundance. Species richness was unrelated to soil texture, total ground cover, and fire frequency. Ant species richness and equitability are potential state indicators of the soil arthropod community. Moreover, equitability can be used to monitor ecosystem change. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032463</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Romme, William H.</author><author>Allen, Craig D.</author><author>Bailey, John D.</author><author>Baker, William L.</author><author>Bestelmeyer, Brandon T.</author><author>Brown, Peter M.</author><author>Eisenhart, Karen S.</author><author>Floyd, M.

Effective management of these ecosystems has been hindered by inadequate understanding of 1) the variability in ecosystem structure and ecological processes that exists among the diverse combinations of piñons, junipers, and associated shrubs, herbs, and soil organisms; 2) the prehistoric and historic disturbance regimes; and 3) the mechanisms driving changes in vegetation structure and composition during the past 150 yr. This article summarizes what we know (and don't know) about three fundamentally different kinds of piñon-juniper vegetation. Persistent woodlands are found where local soils, climate, and disturbance regimes are favorable for piñon, juniper, or a mix of both; fires have always been infrequent in these woodlands. Piñon-juniper savannas are found where local soils and climate are suitable for both trees and grasses; it is logical that low-severity fires may have maintained low tree densities before disruption of fire regimes following Euro-American settlement, but information is insufficient to support any confident statements about historical disturbance regimes in these savannas. Wooded shrublands are found where local soils and climate support a shrub community, but trees can increase during moist climatic conditions and periods without disturbance and decrease during droughts and following disturbance. Dramatic increases in tree density have occurred in portions of all three types of piñon-juniper vegetation, although equally dramatic mortality events have also occurred in some areas. The potential mechanisms driving increases in tree density-such as recovery from past disturbance, natural range expansion, livestock grazing, fire exclusion, climatic variability, and CO2 fertilization-generally have not received enough empirical or experimental investigation to predict which is most important in any given location. The intent of this synthesis is 1) to provide a source of information for managers and policy makers; and 2) to stimulate researchers to address the most important unanswered questions.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1550742409500395</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sieg, Carolyn Hull</author><author>Fulé, Peter Z.</author><author>Hunter, Molly</author><author>Allen, Craig D.</author><author>Brooks, Matthew L.</author><author>Balice, Randy G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fire in the southwest: Integrating fire into management of changing ecosystems</title><secondary-title>Fire Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Fire Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-2</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>April 2009</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.4996/fireecology.0501001</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This special issue includes nine research papers and forum articles that span both ecological and sociological aspects of managing fire in the southwest. The first paper explores the interacting roles of topography, vegetation, and climate in a sky island mountain range of southern Arizona. The second one presents results of greenhouse and field studies designed to assess whether aqueous smoke promotes plant emergence in 61 plant species commonly found in ponderosa pine ( Pinus ponderosa) forests in this region. The next two papers address fire and invasive species in central New Mexico. The other papers explore how the invasion of an African bunchgrass, Lehmann lovegrass ( Eragrostis lehmanniana), influences the effects of fire on small mammals, and present an approach to estimate other societal benefits of vegetation in a wildland-urban interface, including air pollution removal and carbon sequestration and storage. A short communication summarizes post-fire impacts 43 years after a prescribed burn in ponderosa pine forest. The special issue concludes with four forum articles. The first two describes how ranchers and staff from both state and federal agencies and The Nature Conservancy are collaborating to reintroduce fire in the southern borderlands to improve landscape productivity and biological diversity, and a process for incorporating information on recent fires and insect outbreaks in state-and-transition models using an example from northern Arizona. The final two forum papers relating to the Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) programme and new tools that have been designed or modified for BAER team use and make a case for the need for longer term monitoring of recovering ecosystems.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://fireecologyjournal.org/journal/abstract/?abstract=56</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bar Massada, Avi</author><author>Radeloff, Volker C.</author><author>Stewart, Susan I.</author><author>Hawbaker, Todd J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Wildfire risk in the wildland-urban interface: A simulation study in northwestern Wisconsin</title><secondary-title>Forest Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forest Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>1990-1999</pages><volume>258</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>FARSITE</keyword><keyword>Fire risk</keyword><keyword>Fire spread</keyword><keyword>MTT</keyword><keyword>Simulation modeling</keyword><keyword>WUI</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>October 2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0378-1127</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.foreco.2009.07.051</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The rapid growth of housing in and near the wildland-urban interface (WUI) increases wildfire risk to lives and structures. To reduce fire risk, it is necessary to identify WUI housing areas that are more susceptible to wildfire. This is challenging, because wildfire patterns depend on fire behavior and spread, which in turn depend on ignition locations, weather conditions, the spatial arrangement of fuels, and topography. The goal of our study was to assess wildfire risk to a 60,000 ha WUI area in northwestern Wisconsin while accounting for all of these factors. We conducted 6000 simulations with two dynamic fire models: Fire Area Simulator (FARSITE) and Minimum Travel Time (MTT) in order to map the spatial pattern of burn probabilities. Simulations were run under normal and extreme weather conditions to assess the effect of weather on fire spread, burn probability, and risk to structures. The resulting burn probability maps were intersected with maps of structure locations and land cover types. The simulations revealed clear hotspots of wildfire activity and a large range of wildfire risk to structures in the study area. As expected, the extreme weather conditions yielded higher burn probabilities over the entire landscape, as well as to different land cover classes and individual structures. Moreover, the spatial pattern of risk was significantly different between extreme and normal weather conditions. The results highlight the fact that extreme weather conditions not only produce higher fire risk than normal weather conditions, but also change the fine-scale locations of high risk areas in the landscape, which is of great importance for fire management in WUI areas. In addition, the choice of weather data may limit the potential for comparisons of risk maps for different areas and for extrapolating risk maps to future scenarios where weather conditions are unknown. Our approach to modeling wildfire risk to structures can aid fire risk reduction management activities by identifying areas with elevated wildfire risk and those most vulnerable under extreme weather conditions. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378112709005210</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stewart, Susan I</author><author>Wilmer, Bo</author><author>Hammer, Roger B</author><author>Aplet, Gregory H.</author><author>Hawbaker, Todd J</author><author>Miller, Carol</author><author>Radeloff, Volker C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Wildland-urban interface maps vary with purpose and context</title><secondary-title>Journal of Forestry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Forestry</full-title></periodical><pages>78-83</pages><volume>107</volume><issue>March</issue><keywords><keyword>fire policy</keyword><keyword>gis</keyword><keyword>healthy forest restoration act</keyword><keyword>national fire</keyword><keyword>urban interface</keyword><keyword>wildland</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-1201</isbn><abstract>Maps of the wildland-urban interface (WUI) are both policy tools and powerful visual images. Although the growing number of WUI maps serve similar purposes, this article indicates that WUI maps derived from the same data sets can differ in important ways related to their original intended application. We discuss the use of ancillary data in modifying census data to improve WUI maps and offer a cautionary note about this practice. A comparison of two WUI mapping approaches suggests that no single map is "best" because users' needs vary. The analysts who create maps are responsible for ensuring that users understand their purpose, data, and methods; map users are responsible for paying attention to these features and using each map accordingly. These considerations should apply to any analysis but are especially important to analyses of the WUI on which policy decisions will be made.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-67449147168&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=327a1b09fac0689fade7f2181e4bd9bf</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kasischke, Eric S</author><author>Verbyla, David L</author><author>Rupp, T Scott</author><author>McGuire, Anthony</author><author>Murphy, Karen A</author><author>Jandt, R</author><author>Barnes, Jennifer L</author><author>Hoy, E</author><author>Duffy, Paul A</author><author>Calef, Monika</author><author>Turetsky, Merritt R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Alaska’s changing fire regime - Implications for the vulnerability of its boreal forests</title><secondary-title>Canadian Journal of Forest Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canadian Journal of Forest Research</full-title></periodical><pages>1313-1324</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>7</issue><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/X10-098</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70168803</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Conway, Courtney J.</author><author>Nadeau, Christopher P.</author><author>Piest, Linden</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fire helps restore natural disturbance regime to benefit rare and endangered marsh birds endemic to the Colorado River</title><secondary-title>Ecological Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>2024-2035</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Disturbance</keyword><keyword>Prescribed fire</keyword><keyword>Colorado river</keyword><keyword>Emergent marsh</keyword><keyword>Endangered species</keyword><keyword>Habitat quality</keyword><keyword>Habitat restoration</keyword><keyword>Marsh birds</keyword><keyword>Marsh succession</keyword><keyword>Marshlands</keyword><keyword>Rails</keyword><keyword>Wetlands</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1051-0761</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1890/09-1624.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Large flood events were part of the historical disturbance regime within the lower basin of most large river systems around the world. Large flood events are now rare in the lower basins of most large river systems due to flood control structures. Endemic organisms that are adapted to this historical disturbance regime have become less abundant due to these dramatic changes in the hydrology and the resultant changes in vegetation structure. The Yuma Clapper Rail is a federally endangered bird that breeds in emergent marshes within the lower Colorado River basin in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. We evaluated whether prescribed fire could be used as a surrogate disturbance event to help restore historical conditions for the benefit of Yuma Clapper Rails and four sympatric marsh-dependent birds. We conducted call-broadcast surveys for marsh birds within burned and Lunburned (control) plots both pre- and post-burn. Fire increased the numbers of Yuma Clapper Rails and Virginia Rails, and did not affect the numbers of Black Rails, Soras, and Least Bitterns. We found no evidence that detection probability of any of the five species differed between burn and control plots. Our results suggest that prescribed fire can be used to set back succession of emergent marshlands and help mimic the natural disturbance regime in the lower Colorado River basin. Hence, prescribed fire can be used to help increase Yuma Clapper Rail populations without adversely affecting sympatric species. Implementing a coordinated long-term fire management plan within marshes of the lower Colorado River may allow regulatory agencies to remove the Yuma Clapper Rail from the endangered species list.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70037519</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McGinnis, T.

An accurate estimation of plant biomass is essential to predict potential fire behavior, calculate carbon sequestration for global climate change research, assess critical wildlife habitat, and so forth. Reliable allometric equations from simple field measurements are necessary for efficient evaluation of plant biomass. However, allometric equations are not available for many common woody plant taxa in the Sierra Nevada. In this report, we present more than 200 regression equations for the Sierra Nevada western slope that relate crown diameter, plant height, crown volume, stem diameter, and both crown diameter and height to the dry weight of foliage, branches, and entire aboveground biomass. Destructive sampling methods resulted in regression equations that accurately predict biomass from one or two simple, nondestructive field measurements.

To investigate the effects of these fires on the reptile and amphibian communities, we compared the results from prefire herpetofauna and vegetation sampling to two years of postfire sampling across 38 burned and 17 unburned plots. The sampling plots were spread over four vegetation types and four open space areas within San Diego County. Our capture results indicated that burned chaparral and coastal sage scrub plots lost herpetofaunal species diversity after the fires and displayed a significant shift in overall community structure. Shrub and tree cover at the burned plots, averaged across the second and third postfire years, had decreased by 53% in chaparral and 75% in coastal sage scrub. Additionally, postfire herpetofauna community structure at burned plots was more similar to that found in unburned grasslands. In grassland and woodland/riparian vegetation plots, where shrub and tree cover was not significantly affected by fires, we found no differences in the herpetofaunal species diversity or community composition. At the individual species level, Sceloporus occidentalis was the most abundant reptile in these areas both before and after the fires. We saw increases in the net capture rates for several lizard species, including Aspidoscelis tigris, Phrynosoma coronatum, and Uta stansburiana in burned chaparral plots and Aspidoscelis hyperythra and U. stansburiana in burned coastal sage scrub plots. The toad, Bufo boreas, was detected at significantly fewer burned plots in chaparral after the fires. Additionally, we documented decreases in the number of plots occupied by lizards (Elgaria multicarinata), salamanders (Batrachoseps major), and snakes (Coluber constrictor, Lampropeltis getula, Pituophis catenifer,and Masticophis lateralis) in coastal sage scrub and chaparral after the fires. We discuss the individual species results as they relate to such life-history traits as the susceptibility to initial mortality, the response to the altered postfire habitat, and shifts in the availability of potential prey. We foresee that a continued unnatural fire regime will result in a simplification of the southern California reptile and amphibian communities.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1670/08-143.1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>DeFalco, Lesley</author><author>Drake, Karla K</author><author>Scoles-Sciulla, S J</author><author>Bauer, Kyla L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effectiveness of post-fire seeding in desert tortoise Critical Habitat following the 2005 Southern Nevada Fire Complex</title></titles><pages>43-77</pages><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70139963</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Larson, Diane L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Can prescribed fire be used to control Yellow Sweetclover (Meliotus officinalis) in a cool-season mixed-grass prairie?</title></titles><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>515</isbn><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ds515</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Esque, T C</author><author>Young, J A</author><author>Tracy, C R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Short-term effects of experimental fires on a Mojave Desert seed bank</title><secondary-title>Journal of Arid Environments</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Arid Environments</full-title></periodical><pages>1302-1308</pages><volume>74</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Disturbance</keyword><keyword>Invasive</keyword><keyword>Active avoidance</keyword><keyword>Passive avoidance</keyword><keyword>Species composition</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0140-1963</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jaridenv.2010.04.011</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A Mojave Desert shrub community was experimentally burned to understand changes in seed bank of desert annual plant species in response to wildfire. Seed mortality ranged from 55 to 80%, and fire caused significant losses of native and alien annual seeds. Schismus arabicus, Schismus barbatus, Bromus madritensis, Bromus tectorum, Erodium cicutarium and Plantago spp. made up &gt;95% of the seed bank. Bromus spp. and Plantago spp. had proportionately greater mortality of seeds than did Schismus spp. and E. cicutarium. Schismus spp. can be lodged into soil cracks thus avoiding lethal temperatures. E. cicutarium has a self-drilling mechanism that places the seeds at greater depth in the soil. Greater seed mortality occurred beneath shrub canopies than interspaces for most species (Plantago, spp., Bromus spp., and E. cicutarium), but microsite had little effect on Schismus spp. Fire reduced the perennial Ambrosia dumosa densities under canopies. Fire reduced the mean number of species found in samples by about one species per plot and no species was extirpated on experimental plots. The relative abundances of common species did not change dramatically as a result of fire or microsite, however; seed densities varied by treatment and affected interpretations of species compositions. © 2010.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77955173121&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=aa93b2ba58d257679af18578f8e26f5e</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McGuire, A.

The analysis estimates that terrestrial areas of the Arctic Basin lost 62.9 Tg C yr-1 and that the Arctic Ocean gained 94.1 Tg C yr-1. Arctic lands and oceans were a net CO(2) sink of 108.9 Tg C yr-1, which is within the range of uncertainty in estimates from atmospheric inversions. Although both lands and oceans of the Arctic were estimated to be CO(2) sinks, the land sink diminished in strength because of increased fire disturbance compared to previous decades, while the ocean sink increased in strength because of increased biological pump activity associated with reduced sea ice cover. Terrestrial areas of the Arctic were a net source of 41.5 Tg CH(4) yr-1 that increased by 0.6 Tg CH(4) yr-1 during the decade of analysis, a magnitude that is comparable with an atmospheric inversion of CH(4). Because the radiative forcing of the estimated CH(4) emissions is much greater than the CO(2) sink, the analysis suggests that the Arctic Basin is a substantial net source of green house gas forcing to the climate system.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70037529</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Breininger, David R.</author><author>Nichols, James D.</author><author>Duncan, Brean W.</author><author>Stolen, Eric D.</author><author>Carter, Geoffrey M.</author><author>Hunt, Danny K.</author><author>Drese, John H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multistate modeling of habitat dynamics: Factors affecting Florida scrub transition probabilities</title><secondary-title>Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>3354-3364</pages><volume>91</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Land cover</keyword><keyword>Disturbance</keyword><keyword>Fire</keyword><keyword>Restoration</keyword><keyword>Patch dynamics</keyword><keyword>Aphelocoma coerulescens</keyword><keyword>Capture-recapture</keyword><keyword>Florida Scrub-Jay</keyword><keyword>Kennedy space center/merritt island national wildl</keyword><keyword>Multistate models</keyword><keyword>Scrub</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>3214764128</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1890/09-0964.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Many ecosystems are influenced by disturbances that create specific successional states and habitat structures that species need to persist. Estimating transition probabilities between habitat states and modeling the factors that influence such transitions have many applications for investigating and managing disturbance-prone ecosystems. We identify the correspondence between multistate capture-recapture models and Markov models of habitat dynamics. We exploit this correspondence by fitting and comparing competing models of different ecological covariates affecting habitat transition probabilities in Florida scrub and flatwoods, a habitat important to many unique plants and animals. We subdivided a large scrub and flatwoods ecosystem along central Florida's Atlantic coast into 10-ha grid cells, which approximated average territory size of the threatened Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens), a management indicator species. We used 1.0-m resolution aerial imagery for 1994, 1999, and 2004 to classify grid cells into four habitat quality states that were directly related to Florida Scrub-Jay source-sink dynamics and management decision making. Results showed that static site features related to fire propagation (vegetation type, edges) and temporally varying disturbances (fires, mechanical cutting) best explained transition probabilities. Results indicated that much of the scrub and flatwoods ecosystem was resistant to moving from a degraded state to a desired state without mechanical cutting, an expensive restoration tool. We used habitat models parameterized with the estimated transition probabilities to investigate the consequences of alternative management scenarios on future habitat dynamics. We recommend this multistate modeling approach as being broadly applicable for studying ecosystem, land cover, or habitat dynamics. The approach provides maximum-likelihood estimates of transition parameters, including precision measures, and can be used to assess evidence among competing ecological models that describe system dynamics.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70036400</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wolf, By Ruth E</author><author>Hoefen, Todd M</author><author>Hageman, Philip L</author><author>Morman, Suzette A</author><author>Plumlee, Geoffrey S</author><author>Survey, U S Geological</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Speciation of Arsenic , Selenium , and Chromium in Wildfire Impacted Soils and Ashes</title></titles><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2010-1242</isbn><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20101242</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lynch, David K</author><author>Hudnut, Kenneth W</author><author>Dearborn, David S P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Low-altitude aerial color digital photographic survey of the San Andreas Fault</title><secondary-title>Seismological Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Seismological Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>453-459</pages><volume>81</volume><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1785/gssrl.81.3.453</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70042315</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Wagtendonk, Jan W.</author><author>Moore, Peggy E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fuel deposition rates of montane and subalpine conifers in the central Sierra Nevada, California, USA</title><secondary-title>Forest Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forest Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>2122-2132</pages><volume>259</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Fuel deposition</keyword><keyword>Fuel dynamics</keyword><keyword>Yosemite National Park</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0378-1127</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.foreco.2010.02.024</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fire managers and researchers need information on fuel deposition rates to estimate future changes in fuel bed characteristics, determine when forests transition to another fire behavior fuel model, estimate future changes in fuel bed characteristics, and parameterize and validate ecosystem process models. This information is lacking for many ecosystems including the Sierra Nevada in California, USA. We investigated fuel deposition rates and stand characteristics of seven montane and four subalpine conifers in the Sierra Nevada. We collected foliage, miscellaneous bark and crown fragments, cones, and woody fuel classes from four replicate plots each in four stem diameter size classes for each species, for a total of 176 sampling sites. We used these data to develop predictive equations for each fuel class and diameter size class of each species based on stem and crown characteristics. There were consistent species and diameter class differences in the annual amount of foliage and fragments deposited. Foliage deposition rates ranged from just over 50 g m-2 year-1 in small diameter mountain hemlock stands to ∼300 g m-2 year-1 for the three largest diameter classes of giant sequoia. The deposition rate for most woody fuel classes increased from the smallest diameter class stands to the largest diameter class stands. Woody fuel deposition rates varied among species as well. The rates for the smallest woody fuels ranged from 0.8 g m-2 year-1 for small diameter stands of Jeffrey pine to 126.9 g m-2 year-1 for very large diameter stands of mountain hemlock. Crown height and live crown ratio were the best predictors of fuel deposition rates for most fuel classes and species. Both characteristics reflect the amount of crown biomass including foliage and woody fuels. Relationships established in this study allow predictions of fuel loads to be made on a stand basis for each of these species under current and possible future conditions. These predictions can be used to estimate fuel treatment longevity, assist in determining fuel model transitions, and predict future changes in fuel bed characteristics.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70037441</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Grant, Todd A.</author><author>Madden, Elizabeth M.</author><author>Shaffer, Terry L.</author><author>Dockens, Johnida S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of Prescribed Fire on Vegetation and Passerine Birds in Northern Mixed-Grass Prairie</title><secondary-title>Journal of Wildlife Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Wildlife Management</full-title></periodical><pages>1841-1851</pages><volume>74</volume><issue>8</issue><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-541X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2193/2010-006</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Prescribed fire is used widely to manage grasslands on National Wildlife Refuges and other public lands in the northern Great Plains, but its effects on habitat use or production of wildlife in the region are poorly understood. During 1998-2003, we used point counts to examine effects of prescribed fire on vegetation and passerines in a mixed-grass prairie complex in north-central North Dakota, USA (n 5 7 units, each 40-70 ha). Vegetation structure and, to a lesser extent, plant community composition varied with year of study (likely related to changes in annual precipitation) and with number of growing seasons since fire. Fire altered plant structure, especially the amount of residual vegetation, which in turn influenced bird species richness and abundance. The number of indicated pairs for sedge wren (Cistothorus platensis), clay-colored sparrow (Spizella pallida), Le Conte's sparrow (Ammodramus leconteii), Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), and bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) were lowest during the first postfire growing season but generally increased and stabilized within 2-3 postfire growing seasons. Our results support the premise that grassland passerines are well-adapted to frequent, periodic fires, generally corresponding to those occurring prior to Euro-American settlement of the region. Prescribed fire is important for reducing tree and shrub invasion, restoring biological integrity of plant communities, and maintaining or enhancing populations of grassland-dependent bird species. Managers in the northern mixed-grass prairie region should not be overly concerned about reductions in bird abundances that are limited mostly to the first growing season after fire.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.2193/2010-006</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sah, Jay P.</author><author>Ross, Michael S.</author><author>Snyder, James R.</author><author>Ogurcak, Danielle E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tree Mortality following Prescribed Fire and a Storm Surge Event in Slash Pine ( Pinus elliottii var. densa ) Forests in the Florida Keys, USA</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Forestry Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Forestry Research</full-title></periodical><pages>1-13</pages><volume>2010</volume><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1155/2010/204795</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In fire-dependent forests, managers are interested in predicting the consequences of prescribed burning on postfire tree mortality. We examined the effects of prescribed fire on tree mortality in Florida Keys pine forests, using a factorial design with understory type, season, and year of burn as factors. We also used logistic regression to model the effects of burn season, fire severity, and tree dimensions on individual tree mortality. Despite limited statistical power due to problems in carrying out the full suite of planned experimental burns, associations with tree and fire variables were observed. Post-fire pine tree mortality was negatively correlated with tree size and positively correlated with char height and percent crown scorch. Unlike post-fire mortality, tree mortality associated with storm surge from Hurricane Wilma was greater in the large size classes. Due to their influence on population structure and fuel dynamics, the size-selective mortality patterns following fire and storm surge have practical importance for using fire as a management tool in Florida Keys pinelands in the future, particularly when the threats to their continued existence from tropical storms and sea level rise are expected to increase.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijfr/2010/204795/</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Grundel, Ralph</author><author>Jean, Robert P.</author><author>Frohnapple, Krystalynn J.</author><author>Glowacki, Gary A.</author><author>Scott, Peter E.</author><author>Pavlovic, Noel B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Floral and nesting resources, habitat structure, and fire influence bee distribution across an open-forest gradient</title><secondary-title>Ecological Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>1678-1692</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire</keyword><keyword>Bee abundance</keyword><keyword>Bee diversity</keyword><keyword>Habitat specialists</keyword><keyword>Indiana dunes</keyword><keyword>Land use</keyword><keyword>Nestedness</keyword><keyword>Nesting resources</keyword><keyword>Oak savanna</keyword><keyword>Oligolectic</keyword><keyword>Plant richness</keyword><keyword>Species density</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1051-0761</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1890/08-1792.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Given bees' central effect on vegetation communities, it is important to understand how and why bee distributions vary across ecological gradients. We examined how plant community composition, plant diversity, nesting suitability, canopy cover, land use, and fire history affected bee distribution across an open-forest gradient in northwest Indiana, USA, a gradient similar to the historic Midwest United States landscape mosaic. When considered with the other predictors, plant community composition was not a significant predictor of bee community composition. Bee abundance was negatively related to canopy cover and positively to recent fire frequency, bee richness was positively related to plant richness and abundance of potential nesting resources, and bee community composition was significantly related to plant richness, soil characteristics potentially related to nesting suitability, and canopy cover. Thus, bee abundance was predicted by a different set of environmental characteristics than was bee species richness, and bee community composition was predicted, in large part, by a combination of the significant predictors of bee abundance and richness. Differences in bee community composition along the woody vegetation gradient were correlated with relative abundance of oligolectic, or diet specialist, bees. Because oligoleges were rarer than diet generalists and were associated with open habitats, their populations may be especially affected by degradation of open habitats. More habitat-specialist bees were documented for open and forest/scrub habitats than for savanna/woodland habitats, consistent with bees responding to habitats of intermediate woody vegetation density, such as savannas, as ecotones rather than as distinct habitat types. Similarity of bee community composition, similarity of bee abundance, and similarity of bee richness between sites were not significantly related to proximity of sites to each other. Nestedness analysis indicated that species composition in species-poor sites was not merely a subset of species composition at richer sites. The lack of significant proximity or nestedness effects suggests that factors at a small spatial scale strongly influence bees' use of sites. The findings indicate that patterns of plant diversity, nesting resource availability, recent fire, and habitat shading, present at the scale of a few hundred meters, are key determinants of bee community patterns in the mosaic open-savanna-forest landscape.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70037656</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Walsh, Megan K.</author><author>Pearl, Christopher A.</author><author>Whitlock, Cathy</author><author>Bartlein, Patrick J.</author><author>Worona, Marc A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An 11 000-year-long record of fire and vegetation history at Beaver Lake, Oregon, central Willamette Valley</title><secondary-title>Quaternary Science Reviews</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Quaternary Science Reviews</full-title></periodical><pages>1093-1106</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>9-10</issue><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0277-3791</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.quascirev.2010.02.011</electronic-resource-num><abstract>High-resolution macroscopic charcoal and pollen analysis were used to reconstruct an 11 000-year-long record of fire and vegetation history from Beaver Lake, Oregon, the first complete Holocene paleoecological record from the floor of the Willamette Valley. In the early Holocene (ca 11 000-7500 calendar years before present [cal yr BP]), warmer, drier summers than at present led to the establishment of xeric woodland of Quercus, Corylus, and Pseudotsuga near the site. Disturbances (i.e., floods, fires) were common at this time and as a result Alnus rubra grew nearby. High fire frequency occurred in the early Holocene from ca 11 200-9300 cal yr BP. Riparian forest and wet prairie developed in the middle Holocene (ca 7500 cal yr BP), likely the result of a decrease in the frequency of flooding and a shift to effectively cooler, wetter conditions than before. The vegetation at Beaver Lake remained generally unchanged into the late Holocene (from 4000 cal yr BP to present), with the exception of land clearance associated with Euro-American settlement of the valley (ca 160 cal yr BP). Middle-to-late Holocene increases in fire frequency, coupled with abrupt shifts in fire-episode magnitude and charcoal composition, likely indicate the influence anthropogenic burning near the site. The paleoecological record from Beaver Lake, and in particular the general increase in fire frequency over the last 8500 years, differs significantly from other low-elevation sites in the Pacific Northwest, which suggests that local controls (e.g., shifts in vegetation structure, intensification of human land-use), rather than regional climatic controls, more strongly influenced its environmental history. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70037054</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Arkle, Robert S.</author><author>Pilliod, David S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prescribed fires as ecological surrogates for wildfires: A stream and riparian perspective</title><secondary-title>Forest Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forest Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>893-903</pages><volume>259</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Prescribed fire</keyword><keyword>Burn severity</keyword><keyword>Aquatic macroinvertebrate</keyword><keyword>Idaho</keyword><keyword>Mixed conifer forest</keyword><keyword>Riparian</keyword><keyword>Stream</keyword><keyword>Tailed frog</keyword><keyword>Wildfire surrogate</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0378-1127</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.foreco.2009.11.029</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Forest managers use prescribed fire to reduce wildfire risk and to provide resource benefits, yet little information is available on whether prescribed fires can function as ecological surrogates for wildfire in fire-prone landscapes. Information on impacts and benefits of this management tool on stream and riparian ecosystems is particularly lacking. We used a beyond-BACI (Before, After, Control, Impact) design to investigate the effects of a prescribed fire on a stream ecosystem and compared these findings to similar data collected after wildfire. For 3 years after prescribed fire treatment, we found no detectable changes in periphyton, macroinvertebrates, amphibians, fish, and riparian and stream habitats compared to data collected over the same time period in four unburned reference streams. Based on changes in fuels, plant and litter cover, and tree scorching, this prescribed fire was typical of those being implemented in ponderosa pine forests throughout the western U.S. However, we found that the extent and severity of riparian vegetation burned was substantially lower after prescribed fire compared to nearby wildfires. The early-season prescribed fire did not mimic the riparian or in-stream ecological effects observed following a nearby wildfire, even in catchments with burn extents similar to the prescribed fire. Little information exists on the effects of long-term fire exclusion from riparian forests, but a "prescribed fire regime" of repeatedly burning upland forests while excluding fire in adjacent riparian forests may eliminate an important natural disturbance from riparian and stream habitats.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70034210</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mendez, Gregory O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Water-quality data from storm runoff after the 2007 fires, San Diego County, California</title></titles><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2010-1234</isbn><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20101234</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sherrouse, By Benson C</author><author>Riegle, Jodi L</author><author>Semmens, Darius J</author><author>Survey, U S Geological</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Geographic Analysis and Monitoring Program So cia l V alues for E cosystem S ervices ( SolVES ): A GIS Application for Assessing , Mapping , and Quantifying the Social Values of Ecosystem Services — Documentation and User Manual , Version 1 . 0</title></titles><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2010-1219</isbn><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20101219</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jin, Suming</author><author>Yang, Limin</author><author>Xian, George Z</author><author>Danielson, Patrick</author><author>Homer, Collin G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Multi-Index Integrated Change detection method for updating the National Land Cover Database</title></titles><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70041186</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Haines, Aaron M</author><author>Leu, Matthias</author><author>Svancara, Leona K</author><author>Wilson, Gina</author><author>Scott, J Michael</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using a Distribution and Conservation Status Weighted Hotspot Approach to Identify Areas in Need of Conservation Action to Benefit Idaho Bird Species</title><secondary-title>Northwest Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Northwest Science</full-title></periodical><pages>170-182</pages><volume>84</volume><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3955/046.084.0206</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Identification of biodiversity hotspots (hereafter, hotspots) has become\na common strategy to delineate important areas for wildlife\nconservation. However, the use of hotspots has not often incorporated\nimportant habitat types, ecosystem services, anthropogenic activity, or\nconsistency in identifying important conservation areas. The purpose of\nthis study was to identify hotspots to improve avian conservation\nefforts for Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) in the state of\nIdaho, United States. We evaluated multiple approaches to define\nhotspots and used a unique approach based on weighting species by their\ndistribution size and conservation status to identify hotspot areas. All\nhotspot approaches identified bodies of water (Bear Lake, Grays Lake,\nand American Falls Reservoir) as important hotspots for Idaho avian\nSGCN, but we found that the weighted approach produced more congruent\nhotspot areas when compared to other hotspot approaches. To incorporate\nanthropogenic activity into hotspot analysis, we grouped species based\non their sensitivity to specific human threats (i.e., urban development,\nagriculture, fire suppression, grazing, roads, and logging) and\nidentified ecological sections within Idaho that may require specific\nconservation actions to address these human threats using the weighted\napproach. The Snake River Basalts and Overthrust Mountains ecological\nsections were important areas for potential implementation of\nconservation actions to conserve biodiversity. Our approach to\nidentifying hotspots may be useful as part of a larger conservation\nstrategy to aid land managers or local governments in applying\nconservation actions on the ground.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70003733</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lu, Zhong</author><author>Zhang, Jixian</author><author>Zhang, Yonghong</author><author>Dzurisin, Daniel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Monitoring and characterizing natural hazards with satellite InSAR imagery</title><secondary-title>Annals of GIS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of GIS</full-title></periodical><pages>55-66</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Radar</keyword><keyword>Deformation</keyword><keyword>InSAR</keyword><keyword>Interferometric synthetic aperture radar</keyword><keyword>Natural hazards</keyword><keyword>SAR</keyword><keyword>Synthetic aperture radar</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1947-5683</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/19475681003700914</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) provides an all-weather imaging capability for measuring ground-surface deformation and inferring changes in land surface characteristics. InSAR enables scientists to monitor and characterize hazards posed by volcanic, seismic, and hydrogeologic processes, by landslides and wildfires, and by human activities such as mining and fluid extraction or injection. Measuring how a volcano's surface deforms before, during, and after eruptions provides essential information about magma dynamics and a basis for mitigating volcanic hazards. Measuring spatial and temporal patterns of surface deformation in seismically active regions is extraordinarily useful for understanding rupture dynamics and estimating seismic risks. Measuring how landslides develop and activate is a prerequisite to minimizing associated hazards. Mapping surface subsidence or uplift related to extraction or injection of fluids during exploitation of groundwater aquifers or petroleum reservoirs provides fundamental data on aquifer or reservoir properties and improves our ability to mitigate undesired consequences. Monitoring dynamic water-level changes in wetlands improves hydrological modeling predictions and the assessment of future flood impacts. In addition, InSAR imagery can provide near-real-time estimates of fire scar extents and fire severity for wildfire management and control. All-weather satellite radar imagery is critical for studying various natural processes and is playing an increasingly important role in understanding and forecasting natural hazards. © 2010 Taylor &amp; Francis.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70171013</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>DeFalco, Lesley A.</author><author>Esque, Todd C.</author><author>Scoles-Sciulla, Sara J.</author><author>Rodgers, Jane</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Desert wildfire and severe drought diminish survivorship of the long-lived Joshua Tree (Yucca brevifolia; Agavaceae)</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Botany</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Botany</full-title></periodical><pages>243-250</pages><volume>97</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Climate change</keyword><keyword>Mojave desert</keyword><keyword>Agavaceae</keyword><keyword>El ni??o southern oscillation</keyword><keyword>Herbivory</keyword><keyword>Invasive alien annuals</keyword><keyword>Pocket gophers</keyword><keyword>Thomomys bottae</keyword><keyword>Yucca brevifolia</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0002-9122</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3732/ajb.0900032</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Extreme climate events are transforming plant communities in the desert Southwest of the United States. Abundant precipitation in 1998 associated with El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) stimulated exceptional alien annual plant production in the Mojave Desert that fueled wildfires in 1999. Exacerbated by protracted drought, 80% of the burned Yucca brevifolia, a long-lived arborescent monocot, and 26% of unburned plants died at Joshua Tree National Park by 2004. Many burned plants &lt;1 m tall died immediately, and survival of all but the tallest, oldest plants declined to the same low level by 2004. Postfire sprouting prolonged survival, but only at the wetter, high-elevation sites. During succeeding dry years, herbaceous plants were scarce, and individuals of Thomomys bottae (pocket gopher) gnawed the periderm and hollowed stems of Y. brevifolia causing many of them to topple. Thomomys bottae damage reduced plant survivorship at low-elevation, unburned sites and diminished survival of burned plants in all but the driest site, which already had low survival. Accentuated ENSO episodes and more frequent wildfires are expected for the desert Southwest and will likely shift Y. brevifolia population structure toward tall, old adults with fewer opportunities for plant recruitment, thus imperiling the persistence of this unique plant community.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70033976</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Turner, Raymond M.</author><author>Webb, Robert H.</author><author>Esque, Todd C.</author><author>Rogers, Garry F.</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Webb, R H</author><author>Boyer, D E</author><author>Turner, R M</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Repeat photography and low-elevation fire responses in the Southwestern United States</title><secondary-title>Repeat Photography: Methods and Applications in the Natural Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Repeat Photography: Methods and Applications in the Natural Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>223-244</pages><issue>June</issue><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Island Press</publisher><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70042801</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vogel, Jennifer A.</author><author>Koford, Rolf R.</author><author>Debinski, Diane M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Direct and indirect responses of tallgrass prairie butterflies to prescribed burning</title><secondary-title>Journal of Insect Conservation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Insect Conservation</full-title></periodical><pages>663-677</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Prescribed fire</keyword><keyword>Tallgrass prairie</keyword><keyword>Path analysis</keyword><keyword>Butterfly conservation</keyword><keyword>Grassland management</keyword><keyword>Indirect effects</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1084101092</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10841-010-9295-1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fire is an important tool in the conservation and restoration of tallgrass prairie ecosystems. We investigated how both the vegetation composition and butterfly community of tallgrass prairie remnants changed in relation to the elapsed time (in months) since prescribed fire. Butterfly richness and butterfly abundance were positively correlated with the time since burn. Habitat-specialist butterfly richness recovery time was greater than 70 months post-fire and habitat-specialist butterfly abundance recovery time was approximately 50 months post-fire. Thus, recovery times for butterfly populations after prescribed fires in our study were potentially longer than those previously reported. We used Path Analysis to evaluate the relative contributions of the direct effect of time since fire and the indirect effects of time since fire through changes in vegetation composition on butterfly abundance. Path models highlighted the importance of the indirect effects of fire on habitat features, such as increases in the cover of bare ground. Because fire return intervals on managed prairie remnants are often less than 5 years, information on recovery times for habitat-specialist insect species are of great importance.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70037534</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nesmith, J C B</author><author>O'Hara, K L</author><author>van Mantgem, P J</author><author>de Valpine, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The effects of raking on sugar pine mortality following prescribed fire in sequoia and kings canyon national parks, California, USA</title><secondary-title>Fire Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Fire Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>97-116</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Restoration</keyword><keyword>Fire intensity</keyword><keyword>Bark beetles</keyword><keyword>GLMM</keyword><keyword>Large tree retention</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.4996/fireecology.0603097</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Prescribed fire is an important tool for fuel reduction, the control of competing vegetation, and forest restoration. The accumulated fuels associated with historical fire exclusion can cause undesirably high tree mortality rates following prescribed fires and wildfires. This is especially true for sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana Douglas), which is already negatively affected by the introduced pathogen white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola J.C. Fisch. ex Rabenh). We tested the efficacy of raking away fuels around the base of sugar pine to reduce mortality following prescribed fire in Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks, California, USA. This study was conducted in three prescribed fires and included 457 trees, half of which had the fuels around their bases raked away to mineral soil to 0.5 m away from the stem. Fire effects were assessed and tree mortality was recorded for three years after prescribed fires. Overall, raking had no detectable effect on mortality: raked trees averaged 30 % mortality compared to 36 % for unraked trees. There was a significant effect, however, between the interaction of raking and average pre-treatment forest floor fuel depth: the predicted probability of survival of a 50 cm dbh tree was 0.94 vs. 0.96 when average pre-treatment fuel depth was 0 cm for a raked and unraked tree, respectively. When average pre-treatment forest floor fuel depth was 30 cm, the predicted probability of survival for a raked 50 cm dbh tree was 0.60 compared to only 0.07 for an unraked tree. Raking did not affect mortality when fire intensity, measured as percent crown volume scorched, was very low (0 % scorch) or very high (&gt;80 % scorch), but the raking treatment significantly increased the proportion of trees that survived by 9.6 % for trees that burned under moderate fire intensity (1 % to 80 % scorch). Raking significantly reduced the likelihood of bole charring and bark beetle activity three years post fire. Fuel depth and anticipated fire intensity need to be accounted for to maximize the effectiveness of the treatments. Raking is an important management option to reduce tree mortality from prescribed fire, but is most effective under specific fuel and burning conditions.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78650473744&amp;doi=10.4996%2Ffireecology.0603097&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=cbf7947c8a3414a1415bae8d99146353</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Haak, A.

As dramatic and extensive as climatic and environmental trends are for salmonid habitats, global climate models (GCMs) project that many of these trends will continue and even accelerate until at least the middle of the 21st century. Clearly, managers of native salmonids in the western United States should consider adjusting management strategies to accommodate a warmer and possibly drier future. Tools are needed to forecast where important changes may occur and how conservation efforts should be prioritized. Our study examined the influence of changing climate on the persistence of native trout and grayling within 11 western States. The study area ranged from the crests of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada eastward through the Rocky Mountains, Great Basin, and Southwest Deserts within the western United States. The focal taxa were westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi), Yellowstone cutthroat trout (O. clarkii bouvieri), Lahontan cutthroat trout (O. clarkii henshawi), Bonneville cutthroat trout (O. clarkii utah), Colorado River cutthroat trout (O. clarkii pleuriticus), greenback cutthroat trout (O. clarkii stomias), Rio Grande cutthroat trout (O. clarkii virginalis), Apache trout (O. gilae apache), Gila trout (O. gilae gilae), and Montana Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus). All of the species and subspecies that were examined in this study have a high risk in some portion of their range for one or more of the factors analyzed. Drought is the most pervasive threat with 40 percent or more of the historic range for seven taxa at a high risk. Bonneville cutthroat trout are the most vulnerable to drought (&gt;70 percent of the historic range at a high risk). Westslope cutthroat trout are the least likely to be affected by drought, and only 16 percent of its historically occupied subwatersheds is at a high risk. However, much of the area at a high risk lies in the Missouri River Basin where the distribution of westslope cutthroat trout has already contracted significantly and 85 percent of the remaining populations do not meet persistence criteria. A large number of populations within the taxa examined did not meet persistence criteria, particularly in the central and southern extent of the study. Current management and restoration strategies have often focused on the occupied habitat on Federal lands or within conservation easements on private lands. Many of the target populations are small (&lt;500 individuals) and located at higher elevations above barriers to upstream movement; therefore, there is limited opportunity for large-scale movements within habitat patches or for dispersal among patches. Where conditions are limiting, populations may have little opportunity for long-term persistence. Climate change stressors commonly are synergistic with existing ecosystem stressors. That is, the existing integrity of stream channels, riparian habitats, and floodplains may moderate or exacerbate negative effects of climate. If habitats are degraded by existing stressors, negative consequences of climate change may be underestimated by our analysis. On the other hand, more intact watersheds where riparian areas are properly functioning and rivers have access to natural floodplains will be more resilient to disturbances associated with climate change. In spite of these limitations, our results do provide a valuable overview of regional effects and risks to coldwater fish as a result of climate change. The broad-scale perspective can help guide managers and interested stakeholders in developing a strategic conservation framework that will increase resilience in native trout populations and improve resistance to the environmental changes brought on by a warming planet.</abstract><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20101236</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lu, Zhong</author><author>Dzurisin, Daniel</author><author>Jung, Hyung-Sup</author><author>Zhang, Jixian</author><author>Zhang, Yonghong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Radar image and data fusion for natural hazards characterisation</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Image and Data Fusion</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Image and Data Fusion</full-title></periodical><pages>217-242</pages><volume>1</volume><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/19479832.2010.499219</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fusion of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images through interferometric, polarimetric and tomographic processing provides an all - weather imaging capability to characterise and monitor various natural hazards.

Streambed sediments in two Inner Coastal Plain streams (Crosswicks and Raccoon Creeks) that traverse these glauconitic deposits are enriched in arsenic (15-25. mg/kg), and groundwater discharging to the streams contains elevated levels of arsenic (&gt;80 μg/L at a site on Crosswicks Creek) with arsenite generally the dominant species. Low dissolved oxygen, low or undetectable levels of nitrate and sulfate, detectable sulfide concentrations, and high concentrations of iron and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the groundwater indicate that reducing environments are present beneath the streambeds and that microbial activity, fueled by the DOC, is involved in releasing arsenic and iron from the geologic materials. In groundwater with the highest arsenic concentrations at Crosswicks Creek, arsenic respiratory reductase gene (arrA) indicated the presence of arsenic-reducing microbes. From extracted DNA, 16s rRNA gene sequences indicate the microbial community may include arsenic-reducing bacteria that have not yet been described. Once in the stream, iron is oxidized and precipitates as hydroxide coatings on the sediments. Arsenite also is oxidized and co-precipitates with or is sorbed to the iron hydroxides. Consequently, dissolved arsenic concentrations are lower in streamwater than in the groundwater, but the arsenic contributed by groundwater becomes part of the arsenic load in the stream when sediments are suspended during high flow. A strong positive relation between concentrations of arsenic and DOC in the groundwater samples indicates that any process-natural or anthropogenic-that increases the organic carbon concentration in the groundwater could stimulate microbial activity and thus increase the amount of arsenic that is released from the geologic materials. © 2010.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70003524</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McGinnis, Thomas W.</author><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author><author>Stephens, Scott L.</author><author>Roller, Gary B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fuel buildup and potential fire behavior after stand-replacing fires, logging fire-killed trees and herbicide shrub removal in Sierra Nevada forests</title><secondary-title>Forest Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forest Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>22-35</pages><volume>260</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire behavior</keyword><keyword>Cheatgrass</keyword><keyword>Conifer plantations</keyword><keyword>Fuel</keyword><keyword>Salvage logging</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0378-1127</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.foreco.2010.03.026</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Typically, after large stand-replacing fires in mid-elevation Sierra Nevada forests, dense shrub fields occupy sites formerly occupied by mature conifers, until eventually conifers overtop and shade out shrubs. Attempting to reduce fuel loads and expedite forest regeneration in these areas, the USDA Forest Service often disrupts this cycle by the logging of fire-killed trees, replanting of conifers and killing of shrubs. We measured the effects of these treatments on live and dead fuel loads and alien species and modeled potential fire behavior and fire effects on regenerating forests. Sampling occurred in untreated, logged and herbicide-treated stands throughout the Sierra Nevada in four large fire areas 4-21 years after stand-replacing fires. Logging fire-killed trees significantly increased total available dead fuel loads in the short term but did not affect shrub cover, grass and forb cover, alien species cover or alien species richness. Despite the greater available dead fuel loads, fire behavior was not modeled to be different between logged and untreated stands, due to abundant shrub fuels in both logged and untreated stands. In contrast, the herbicide treatment directed at shrubs resulted in extremely low shrub cover, significantly greater alien species richness and significantly greater alien grass and forb cover. Grass and forb cover was strongly correlated with solar radiation on the ground, which may be the primary reason that grass and forb cover was higher in herbicide treated stands with low shrub and tree cover. Repeat burning exacerbated the alien grass problem in some stands. Although modeled surface fire flame lengths and rates of spread were found to be greater in stands dominated by shrubs, compared to low shrub cover conifer plantations, surface fire would still be intense enough to kill most trees, given their small size and low crown heights in the first two decades after planting.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70176770</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wickland, Kimberly P.</author><author>Neff, Jason C.</author><author>Harden, Jennifer W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The role of soil drainage class in carbon dioxide exchange and decomposition in boreal black spruce ( Picea mariana ) forest stands</title><secondary-title>Canadian Journal of Forest Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canadian Journal of Forest Research</full-title></periodical><pages>2123-2134</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>11</issue><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/X10-163</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/10.1139/X10-163</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cannon, Susan H.</author><author>Gartner, Joseph E.</author><author>Rupert, Michael G.</author><author>Michael, John A.</author><author>Rea, Alan H.</author><author>Parrett, Charles</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predicting the probability and volume of postwildfire debris flows in the intermountain western United States</title><secondary-title>Bulletin of the Geological Society of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bulletin of the Geological Society of America</full-title></periodical><pages>127-144</pages><volume>122</volume><issue>1-2</issue><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1130/B26459.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Empirical models to estimate the probabil- ity of occurrence and volume of postwildfire debris flows can be quickly implemented in a geographic information system (GIS) to gen- erate debris-flow hazard maps either before or immediately following wildfires. Models that can be used to calculate the probability of debris-flow production from individual drainage basins in response to a given storm were developed using logistic regression analyses of a database from 388 basins lo- cated in 15 burned areas located throughout the U.S. Intermountain West. The models de- scribe debris-flow probability as a function of readily obtained measures of areal burned extent, soil properties, basin morphology, and rainfall from short-duration and low- recurrence-interval convective rainstorms. A model for estimating the volume of mate- rial that may issue from a basin mouth in re- sponse to a given storm was developed using multiple linear regression analysis of a data- base from 56 basins burned by eight fires. This model describes debris-flow volume as a function of the basin gradient, aerial burned extent, and storm rainfall. Applications of a probability model and the volume model for hazard assessments are illustrated using information from the 2003 Hot Creek fire in central Idaho. The predictive strength of the approach in this setting is evaluated us- ing information on the response of this fire to a localized thunderstorm in August 2003. The mapping approach presented here iden- tifies those basins that are most prone to the largest debris-flow events and thus provides information necessary to prioritize areas for postfire erosion mitigation, warnings, and prefire management efforts throughout the Intermountain West.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70037178</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Arkle, Robert S.</author><author>Pilliod, David S.</author><author>Strickler, Katherine</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fire, flow and dynamic equilibrium in stream macroinvertebrate communities</title><secondary-title>Freshwater Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Freshwater Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>299-314</pages><volume>55</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Burn severity</keyword><keyword>Dynamic equilibrium</keyword><keyword>Macroinvertebrate community</keyword><keyword>Peak streamflow</keyword><keyword>Wildfire disturbance</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1365-2427</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02275.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>1. The complex effects of disturbances on ecological communities can be further complicated by subsequent perturbations within an ecosystem. We investigated how wildfire interacts with annual variations in peak streamflow to affect the stability of stream macroinvertebrate communities in a central Idaho wilderness, USA. We conducted a 4-year retrospective analysis of unburned (n = 7) and burned (n = 6) catchments, using changes in reflectance values (ΔNBR) from satellite imagery to quantify the percentage of each catchment’s riparian and upland vegetation that burned at high and low severity. 2. For this wildland fire complex, increasing riparian burn severity and extent were associated with greater year-to-year variation, rather than a perennial increase, in sediment loads, organic debris, large woody debris (LWD) and undercut bank structure. Temporal changes in these variables were correlated with yearly peak flow in burned catchments but not in unburned reference catchments, indicating that an interaction between fire and flow can result in decreased habitat stability in burned catchments. 3. Streams in more severely burned catchments exhibited increasingly dynamic macroinvertebrate communities and did not show increased similarity to reference streams over time. Annual variability in macroinvertebrates was attributed, predominantly, to the changing influence of sediment, LWD, riparian cover and organic debris, as quantities of these habitat components fluctuated annually depending on burn severity and annual peak streamflows. 4. These analyses suggest that interactions among fire, flow and stream habitat may increase inter-annual habitat variability and macroinvertebrate community dynamics for a duration approaching the length of the historic fire return interval of the study area.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70034177</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McGuire, A.

Release of stored carbon to the atmosphere in response to this change has the potential to affect the global climate system. Studies indicate that the northern cryosphere has been not only a substantial sink for atmospheric CO2 in recent decades, but also an important source of CH4 because of emissions from wetlands and lakes. Analyses suggest that the sensitivity of the carbon cycle of the region over the 21st Century is potentially large, but highly uncertain because numerous pathways of response will be affected by warming. Further research should focus on sensitive elements of the carbon cycle such as the consequences of increased fire disturbance, permafrost degradation, and sea ice loss in the northern cryosphere region. © 2010.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70168807</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Betts, M.

However, quantitative information about the strength and direction of species associations with broadleaf cover at landscape scales are rare. Uncovering such habitat relationships is essential for understanding the demography of species and in developing sound conservation strategies. It is particularly important to detect points in habitat reduction where rates of population decline may accelerate or the likelihood of species occurrence drops rapidly (i.e., thresholds). Here, we use a large avian point-count data set (N = 4375) from southwestern and northwestern Oregon along with segmented logistic regression to test for thresholds in forest bird occurrence as a function of broadleaf forest and early-seral broadleaf forest at local (150-m radius) and landscape (500-2000-m radius) scales. All 12 bird species examined showed positive responses to either broadleaf forest in general, and/or early-seral broadleaf forest. However, regional variation in species response to these conditions was high. We found considerable evidence for landscape thresholds in bird species occurrence as a function of broadleaf cover; threshold models received substantially greater support than linear models for eight of 12 species. Landscape thresholds in broadleaf forest ranged broadly from 1.35% to 24.55% mean canopy cover. Early-seral broadleaf thresholds tended to be much lower (0.22-1.87%). We found a strong negative relationship between the strength of species association with early-seral broadleaf forest and 42-year bird population trends; species most associated with this forest type have declined at the greatest rates. Taken together, these results provide the first support for the hypothesis that reductions in broadleaf-dominated early-seral forest due to succession and intensive forest management have led to population declines of constituent species in the Pacific northwestern United States. Forest management treatments that maintain or restore even small amounts of broadleaf vegetation could mitigate further declines.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70003734</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cannon, Susan H</author><author>Gartner, Joseph E</author><author>Rupert, Michael G</author><author>Michael, John A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Emergency assessments of postfire debris-flow hazards for the 2009 La Brea, Jesusita, Guiberson, Morris, Sheep, Oak Glen, Pendleton, and Cottonwood fires in southern California</title></titles><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2010-1186</isbn><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20101186</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Epperson, D.

We investigated the impacts of fire ants on the upland arthropod community on 2040 ha study sites in southern Mississippi. Study sites were sampled from 1997–2000 before, during, and after fire ant bait treatments to reduce fire ant populations. Fire ant abundance was assessed with bait transects on all sites, and fire ant population indices were estimated on a subset of study sites. Species richness and diversity of other ant species was also assessed from bait transects. Insect biomass and diversity was determined from light trap samples. Following treatments, fire ant abundance and population indices were significantly reduced, and ant species diversity and richness were greater on treated sites. Arthropod biomass, species diversity and species richness estimated from light trap samples were negatively correlated with fire ant abundance, but there were no observable treatment effects. Solenopsis invicta has the potential to negatively impact native arthropod communities resulting in a potential loss of both species and function.

Empirical models derived from statistical evaluation of data collected from recently burned basins throughout the intermountain western United States were used to estimate the probability of debris-flow occurrence and volumes of debris flows for selected drainage basins. Data for the models include burn severity, rainfall total and intensity for a 25-year-recurrence, 1-hour-duration rainstorm, and topographic and soil property characteristics. Several of the selected drainage basins in Fourmile Creek and Gold Run were identified as having probabilities of debris-flow occurrence greater than 60 percent, and many more with probabilities greater than 45 percent, in response to the 25-year recurrence, 1-hour rainfall. None of the Fourmile Canyon Creek drainage basins selected had probabilities greater than 45 percent. Throughout the Gold Run area and the Fourmile Creek area upstream from Gold Run, the higher probabilities tend to be in the basins with southerly aspects (southeast, south, and southwest slopes). Many basins along the perimeter of the fire area were identified as having low probability of occurrence of debris flow. Volume of debris flows predicted from drainage basins with probabilities of occurrence greater than 60 percent ranged from 1,200 to 9,400 m3. The predicted moderately high probabilities and some of the larger volumes responses predicted for the modeled storm indicate a potential for substantial debris-flow effects to buildings, roads, bridges, culverts, and reservoirs located both within these drainages and immediately downstream from the burned area. However, even small debris flows that affect structures at the basin outlets could cause considerable damage.</abstract><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2010/1244/</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Finn, Sean P</author><author>Kitchell, Kate</author><author>Baer, Lori Anne</author><author>Bedford, David R</author><author>Brooks, Matthew L</author><author>Flint, Alan L</author><author>Flint, Lorraine E</author><author>Matchett, J R</author><author>Mathie, Amy</author><author>Miller, David M</author><author>Pilliod, David S</author><author>Torregrosa, Alicia</author><author>Woodward, Andrea</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Great Basin Integrated Landscape Monitoring Pilot Summary Report</title></titles><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2010-1324</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20101324</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barrett, K.</author><author>Kasischke, E.

In addition to quantifying changes to the spatial and temporal patterns of burned areas, observing variations in severity is the key to studying the impact of changes to the fire regime on carbon cycling, energy budgets, and post-fire succession. Remote sensing indices of fire severity have not consistently been well-correlated with in situ observations of important severity characteristics in Alaskan black spruce stands, including depth of burning of the surface organic layer. The incorporation of ancillary data such as in situ observations and GIS layers with spectral data from Landsat TM/ETM+ greatly improved efforts to map the reduction of the organic layer in burned black spruce stands. Using a regression tree approach, the R2of the organic layer depth reduction models was 0.60 and 0.55 (p &lt; 0.01) for relative and absolute depth reduction, respectively. All of the independent variables used by the regression tree to estimate burn depth can be obtained independently of field observations. Implementation of a gradient boosting algorithm improved the R2to 0.80 and 0.79 (p &lt; 0.01) for absolute and relative organic layer depth reduction, respectively. Independent variables used in the regression tree model of burn depth included topographic position, remote sensing indices related to soil and vegetation characteristics, timing of the fire event, and meteorological data. Post-fire organic layer depth characteristics are determined for a large (&gt; 200,000 ha) fire to identify areas that are potentially vulnerable to a shift in post-fire succession. This application showed that 12% of this fire event experienced fire severe enough to support a change in post-fire succession. We conclude that non-parametric models and ancillary data are useful in the modeling of the surface organic layer fire depth. Because quantitative differences in post-fire surface characteristics do not directly influence spectral properties, these modeling techniques provide better information than the use of remote sensing data alone.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70034551</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Burgman, M.

Terrestrial ecosystems and, in particular, forests exert strong controls on the global carbon cycle and influence regional hydrology and climatology directly through water and surface energy budgets [Bonan, 2008; Chapin et al., 2008]. According to new research, tree mortality associated with elevated temperatures and drought has the potential to rapidly alter for- est ecosystems, potentially affecting feed- backs to the Earth system [Allen et al., 2010]. Several lines of recent research demonstrate how tree mortality rates in forests may be sen- sitive to climate change— particularly warm- ing and drying. This emerging consequence of global change has important effects on Earth system processes (Figure 1).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://doi.wiley.com/10.1029/2010EO170003</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Allen, Craig D.</author><author>Macalady, Alison K.</author><author>Chenchouni, Haroun</author><author>Bachelet, Dominique</author><author>McDowell, Nate</author><author>Vennetier, Michel</author><author>Kitzberger, Thomas</author><author>Rigling, Andreas</author><author>Breshears, David D.</author><author>Hogg, E.

Increases in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of drought and heat stress associated with climate change could fundamentally alter the composition, structure, and biogeography of forests in many regions. Of particular concern are potential increases in tree mortality associated with climate-induced physiological stress and interactions with other climate-mediated processes such as insect outbreaks and wildfire. Despite this risk, existing projections of tree mortality are based on models that lack functionally realistic mortality mechanisms, and there has been no attempt to track observations of climate-driven tree mortality globally. Here we present the first global assessment of recent tree mortality attributed to drought and heat stress. Although episodic mortality occurs in the absence of climate change, studies compiled here suggest that at least some of the world's forested ecosystems already may be responding to climate change and raise concern that forests may become increasingly vulnerable to higher background tree mortality rates and die-off in response to future warming and drought, even in environments that are not normally considered water-limited. This further suggests risks to ecosystem services, including the loss of sequestered forest carbon and associated atmospheric feedbacks. Our review also identifies key information gaps and scientific uncertainties that currently hinder our ability to predict tree mortality in response to climate change and emphasizes the need for a globally coordinated observation system. Overall, our review reveals the potential for amplified tree mortality due to drought and heat in forests worldwide.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S037811270900615X</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bastion, Henry</author><author>Long, Don</author><author>Lundberg, Brenda</author><author>Kost, Jay</author><author>Natharius, Jeffrey A</author><author>Kreilick, Heather</author><author>Martin, Charley</author><author>Smail, Tobin</author><author>Napoli, James</author><author>Hann, Wendel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>LANDFIRE 2001 and 2008 Refresh Geographic Area Report--Pacific Southwest</title></titles><pages>94-94</pages><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70042134</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Syphard, Alexandra D</author><author>Keeley, Jon E</author><author>Brennan, Teresa J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparing the role of fuel breaks across southern California national forests</title><secondary-title>Forest Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forest Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>2038-2048</pages><volume>261</volume><issue>11</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70004578</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>White, Joseph D</author><author>Gutzwiller, Kevin J</author><author>Barrow, Wylie C</author><author>Johnson-Randall, Lori</author><author>Zygo, Lisa</author><author>Swint, Pamela</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Understanding interaction effects of climate change and fire management on bird distributions through combined process and habitat models</title><secondary-title>Conservation Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Conservation Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>536-546</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01684.x</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70033997</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Massada, Avi Bar</author><author>Syphard, Alexandra D</author><author>Hawbaker, Todd J</author><author>Stewart, Susan I</author><author>Radeloff, Volker C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of ignition location models on the burn patterns of simulated wildfires</title><secondary-title>Environmental Modelling &amp; Software</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Modelling &amp; Software</full-title></periodical><pages>583-592</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>FARSITE</keyword><keyword>Burn probability</keyword><keyword>Ignition</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.envsoft.2010.11.016</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Abstract Fire simulation studies that use models such as FARSITE often assume that ignition locations are distributed randomly, because spatially explicit information about actual ignition locations are difficult to obtain. However, many studies show that the spatial distribution of ignition locations, whether human-caused or natural, is non-random. Thus, predictions from fire simulations based on random ignitions may be unrealistic. However, the extent to which the assumption of ignition location affects the predictions of fire simulation models has never been systematically explored. Our goal was to assess the difference in fire simulations that are based on random versus non-random ignition location patterns. We conducted four sets of 6000 FARSITE simulations for the Santa Monica Mountains in California to quantify the influence of random and non-random ignition locations and normal and extreme weather conditions on fire size distributions and spatial patterns of burn probability. Under extreme weather conditions, fires were significantly larger for non-random ignitions compared to random ignitions (mean area of 344.5 ha and 230.1 ha, respectively), but burn probability maps were highly correlated (r = 0.83). Under normal weather, random ignitions produced significantly larger fires than non-random ignitions (17.5 ha and 13.3 ha, respectively), and the spatial correlations between burn probability maps were not high (r = 0.54), though the difference in the average burn probability was small. The results of the study suggest that the location of ignitions used in fire simulation models may substantially influence the spatial predictions of fire spread patterns. However, the spatial bias introduced by using a random ignition location model may be minimized if the fire simulations are conducted under extreme weather conditions when fire spread is greatest.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815210003233</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database

wildfires have increased in frequency and extent, so have the number of homes developed in the wildland– urban interface. In California, the predominant approach to mitigating fire risk is construction of fuel breaks, but there has been little empirical study of their role in controlling large fires.Weconstructed a spatial database of fuel breaks on the Los Padres National Forest in southern California to better understand characteristics of fuel breaks that affect the behaviour of large fires and to mapwhere fires and fuel breaks most commonly intersect. Weevaluated whether fires stopped or crossed over fuel breaks over a 28-year period and compared the outcomes with physical characteristics of the sites, weather and firefighting activities during the fire event. Many fuel breaks never intersected fires, but others intersected several, primarily in historically fire-prone areas. Fires stopped at fuel breaks 46% of the time, almost invariably owing to fire suppression activities. Firefighter access to treatments, smaller fires and longer fuel breaks were significant direct influences, and younger vegetation and fuel break maintenance indirectly improved the outcome by facilitating firefighter access. This study illustrates the importance of strategic location of fuel breaks because they have been most effective where they provided access for firefighting activities.

Uncertainties regarding the fate of SOC are greater in high-latitude systems where data are sparse and the soils are affected by sub-zero temperatures. To address these issues in Alaska, a first-order assessment of data gaps and spatial distributions of SOC was conducted from a recently compiled soil carbon database. Temperature and landform type were the dominant controls on SOC distribution for selected ecoregions. Mean SOC pools (to a depth of 1-m) varied by three, seven and ten-fold across ecoregion, landform, and ecosystem types, respectively. Climate interactions with landform type and SOC were greatest in the uplands. For upland SOC there was a six-fold non-linear increase in SOC with latitude (i.e., temperature) where SOC was lowest in the Intermontane Boreal compared to the Arctic Tundra and Coastal Rainforest. Additionally, in upland systems mineral SOC pools decreased as climate became more continental, suggesting that the lower productivity, higher decomposition rates and fire activity, common in continental climates, interacted to reduce mineral SOC. For lowland systems, in contrast, these interactions and their impacts on SOC were muted or absent making SOC in these environments more comparable across latitudes. Thus, the magnitudes of SOC change across temperature gradients were non-uniform and depended on landform type. Additional factors that appeared to be related to SOC distribution within ecoregions included stand age, aspect, and permafrost presence or absence in black spruce stands. Overall, these results indicate the influence of major interactions between temperature-controlled decomposition and topography on SOC in high-latitude systems. However, there remains a need for more SOC data from wetlands and boreal-region permafrost soils, especially at depths &gt; 1 m in order to fully understand the effects of climate on soil carbon in Alaska. © 2011.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70034502</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Edit Bowen, Zachary H</author><author>Aldridge, Cameron L</author><author>Anderson, Patrick J</author><author>Assal, Timothy J</author><author>Biewick, Laura R H</author><author>Blecker, Steven W</author><author>Boughton, Gregory K</author><author>Bristol, R Sky</author><author>Carr, Natasha B</author><author>Chalfoun, Anna D</author><author>Chong, Geneva W</author><author>Clark, Melanie L</author><author>Diffendorfer, Jay E</author><author>Fedy, Bradley C</author><author>Foster, Katharine</author><author>Garman, Steven L</author><author>Germaine, Stephen S</author><author>Holloway, JoAnn</author><author>Homer, Collin G</author><author>Kauffman, Matthew J</author><author>Keinath, Douglas</author><author>Latysh, Natalie</author><author>Manier, Daniel J</author><author>McDougal, Robert R</author><author>Melcher, Cynthia P</author><author>Miller, Kirk A</author><author>Montag, Jessica</author><author>Potter, Christopher J</author><author>Schell, Spencer</author><author>Shafer, Sarah L</author><author>Smith, David B</author><author>Stillings, Lisa M</author><author>Tuttle, Michele L W</author><author>Wilson, Anna B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>U.S. Geological Survey Science for the Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative-2010 Annual Report</title></titles><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2011-1219</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20111219</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Crow, Claire</author><author>van Riper III, Charles</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Avian community responses to juniper woodland structure and thinning treatments on the Colorado Plateau</title></titles><pages>37-37</pages><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2011-1109</isbn><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20111109</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Peterson, Birgit</author><author>Nelson, Kurtis</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Developing a Regional Canopy Fuels Assessment Strategy using Multi- Scale Lidar</title><secondary-title>SilviLaser</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SilviLaser</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>canopy bulk density</keyword><keyword>fire behavior modeling</keyword><keyword>FlamMap</keyword><keyword>fuels mapping</keyword><keyword>GLAS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Accurate assessments of canopy fuels are needed by fire scientists to understand fire behavior and to predict future fire occurrence. A key descriptor for canopy fuels is canopy bulk density (CBD). CBD is closely linked to the structure of the canopy; therefore, lidar measurements are particularly well suited to assessments of CBD. LANDFIRE scientists are exploring methods to integrate airborne and spaceborne lidar datasets into a national mapping effort. In this study, airborne lidar, spaceborne lidar, and field data are used to map CBD in the Yukon Flats Ecoregion, with the airborne lidar serving as a bridge between the field data and the spaceborne observations. The field-based CBD was positively correlated with airborne lidar observations (R 2 = 0.78). Mapped values of CBD using the airborne lidar dataset were significantly correlated with spaceborne lidar observations when analyzed by forest type (R 2 = 0.62, evergreen and R 2 = 0.71, mixed). Though continued research is necessary to validate these results, they do support the feasibility of airborne and, most importantly, spaceborne lidar data for canopy fuels assessment.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70156802</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Picotte, Joshua J.</author><author>Robertson, Kevin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Timing constraints on remote sensing of wildland fire burned area in the southeastern US</title><secondary-title>Remote Sensing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Remote Sensing</full-title></periodical><pages>1680-1690</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Prescribed fire</keyword><keyword>Burn severity</keyword><keyword>Normalized burn ratio</keyword><keyword>Apalachicola national forest</keyword><keyword>Cloud cover</keyword><keyword>Depression swamp</keyword><keyword>Differenced normalized burn ratio</keyword><keyword>dNBR</keyword><keyword>NBR</keyword><keyword>Wet flatwoods</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>20724292 (ISSN)</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/rs3081680</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Remote sensing using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite imagery is increasingly used for mapping wildland fire burned area and burn severity, owing to its frequency of collection, relatively high resolution, and availability free of charge. However, rapid response of vegetation following fire and frequent cloud cover pose challenges to this approach in the southeastern US. We assessed these timing constraints by using a series of Landsat TM images to determine how rapidly the remotely sensed burn scar signature fades following prescribed burns in wet flatwoods and depression swamp community types in the Apalachicola National Forest, Florida, USA during 2006. We used both the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) of reflectance bands sensitive to vegetation and exposed soil cover, as well as the change in NBR from before to after fire (dNBR), to estimate burned area. We also determined the average and maximum amount of time following fire required to obtain a cloud-free image for burns in each month of the year, as well as the predicted effect of this time lag on percent accuracy of burn scar estimates. Using both NBR and dNBR, the detectable area decreased linearly 9% per month on average over the first four months following fire. Our findings suggest that the NBR and dNBR methods for monitoring burned area in common southeastern US vegetation community types are limited to an average of 78-90% accuracy among months of the year, with individual burns having values as low as 38%, if restricted to use of Landsat 5 TM imagery. However, the majority of burns can still be mapped at accuracies similar to those in other regions of the US, and access to additional sources of satellite imagery would improve overall accuracy. © 2011 by the authors.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70157328</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brehme, Cheryl S.</author><author>Clark, Denise R.</author><author>Rochester, Carlton J.</author><author>Fisher, Robert N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Wildfires alter rodent community structure across four vegetation types in Southern California, USA</title><secondary-title>Fire Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Fire Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>81-98</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Small mammals</keyword><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Chaparral</keyword><keyword>Coastal sage scrub</keyword><keyword>Chaetodipus</keyword><keyword>Dipodomys</keyword><keyword>Grassland</keyword><keyword>Neotoma</keyword><keyword>Peromyscus</keyword><keyword>Woodland</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1933-9747</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.4996/fireecology.0702081</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We surveyed burned and unburned plots across four habitat reserves in San Diego County, California, USA, in 2005 and 2006, to assess the effects of the 2003 wildfires on the com- munity structure and relative abundance of rodent species. The reserves each contained multiple vegetation types (coastal sage scrub, chaparral, woodland, and grassland) and spanned from 250 m to 1078 m in elevation. Multivariate analyses revealed a more sim- plified rodent community structure in all burned habitats in comparison to unburned habi- tats. Reduction in shrub and tree cover was highly predictive of changes in post-fire ro- dent community structure in the burned coastal sage scrub and chaparral habitats. Reduc- tion in cover was not predictive for the less substantially burned woodlands and grass- lands, for which we hypothesized that interspecific competition played a greater role in post-fire community structure. Across vegetation types, generalists and open habitat spe- cialists typically increased in relative abundance, whereas closed habitat specialists de- creased. We documented significant increases in relative abundance of the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus Wagner) and Dulzura kangaroo rat (Dipodomys simulans Mer- riam). In contrast, we found significant decreases in relative abundance for the CaliforniaMerriam), desert woodrat (Neotoma lepida Thomas), and brush mouse (Peromyscus boylii Baird). Currently, our research program involves assessment of whether habitat conserva- tion plans (HCPs) in southern California provide long-term protection to HCP covered species, as well as preserve ecosystem function. The scenario of increased wildfires needs to be incorporated into this assessment. We discuss our results in relation to management and conservation planning under a future scenario of larger and more frequent wildfires in southern California.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70004996</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Leu, Matthias</author><author>Hanser, Steven E</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Knick, Steven T</author><author>Connelly, John W</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Influences of the human footprint on sagebrush landscape patterns: Implications for sage-grouse conservation</title><secondary-title>Greater Sage-Grouse: Ecology and conservation of a landscape species and its habitats</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Greater Sage-Grouse: Ecology and conservation of a landscape species and its habitats</full-title></periodical><pages>383-405</pages><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70004648</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Flores, Conception</author><author>Bounds, Dixie L.</author><author>Ruby, Douglas E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Does prescribed fire benefit wetland vegetation?</title><secondary-title>Wetlands</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Wetlands</full-title></periodical><pages>35-44</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Biomass</keyword><keyword>Distichlis spicata</keyword><keyword>Marsh</keyword><keyword>Schoenoplectus americanus</keyword><keyword>Spartina alterniflora</keyword><keyword>Spartina patens</keyword><keyword>Stem density</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0277-5212</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s13157-010-0131-x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The effects of fire on wetland vegetation in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States are poorly known, despite the historical use of fire by federal, state, and private landowners in the Chesapeake Bay Region. Prescribed fire is widely used by land managers to promote vegetation that is beneficial to migratory waterfowl, muskrats, and other native wildlife and to reduce competition from less desirable plant species. We compared vegetative response to two fire rotations, annual burns and 3-year burns, and two control sites, Control 1 and Control 2. We tested the effects of fire within six tidal marsh wetlands at Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge and Fishing Bay Wildlife Management Area in Maryland. We examined changes in total live biomass (all species), total stem density, litter, and changes in live biomass and stem density of four dominant wetland plant species (11 variables). Our results suggest that annual prescribed fires will decrease the accumulation of litter, increase the biomass and stem densities of some wetland plants generally considered less desirable for wildlife, and have little or no effect on other wetland plants previously thought to benefit from fire. © 2011 US Government.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70036904</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dwyer, J</author><author>Dinardo, T</author><author>Muchoney, D</author><author>T, Dinardo</author><author>Muchoney, D</author><author>Dinardo, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Developing Climate Data Records and Essential Climate Variables from Landsat Data</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the 34th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the 34th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment</full-title></periodical><pages>1-3</pages><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70156666</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sleeter, Benjamin M.</author><author>Wilson, Tamara S.</author><author>Soulard, Christopher E.</author><author>Liu, Jinxun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimation of late twentieth century land-cover change in California</title><secondary-title>Environmental Monitoring and Assessment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Monitoring and Assessment</full-title></periodical><pages>251-266</pages><volume>173</volume><issue>1-4</issue><keywords><keyword>Land cover</keyword><keyword>California</keyword><keyword>Land use</keyword><keyword>Change</keyword><keyword>Trends</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1573-2959 (Electronic)\r0167-6369 (Linking)</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10661-010-1385-8</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We present the first comprehensive multi-temporal analysis of land-cover change for California across its major ecological regions and primary land-cover types. Recently completed satellite-based estimates of land-cover and land-use change information for large portions of the United States allow for consistent measurement and comparison across heterogeneous landscapes. Landsat data were employed within a pure-panel stratified one-stage cluster sample to estimate and characterize land-cover change for 1973-2000. Results indicate anthropogenic and natural disturbances, such as forest cutting and fire, were the dominant changes, followed by large fluctuations between agriculture and rangelands. Contrary to common perception, agriculture remained relatively stable over the 27-year period with an estimated loss of 1.0% of agricultural land. The largest net declines occurred in the grasslands/shrubs class at 5,131 km2 and forest class at 4,722 km2. Developed lands increased by 37.6%, composing an estimated 4.2% of the state's land cover by 2000.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70004836</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nagler, Pamela L.</author><author>Glenn, Edward P.</author><author>Jarnevich, Catherine S.</author><author>Shafroth, Patrick B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Distribution and abundance of Saltcedar and Russian Olive in the Western United States</title><secondary-title>Critical Reviews in Plant Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Critical Reviews in Plant Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>508-523</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Area</keyword><keyword>Extent</keyword><keyword>Invasive species interactions</keyword><keyword>Management</keyword><keyword>Russian olive</keyword><keyword>Saltcedar</keyword><keyword>Tamarisk</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0735-2689</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/07352689.2011.615689</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Over the past century, two introduced Eurasian trees, saltcedar (Tamarix spp.) and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia) have become wide spread on western United States of American (U. S.) rivers. This paper reviews the literature on the following five key areas related to their distribution and abundance in the western United States: (1) the history of introduction, planting, and spread of saltcedar and Russian olive; (2) their current distribution; (3) their current abundance; (4) factors controlling their current distribution and abundance; and (5) models that have been developed to predict their future distribution and abundance. Saltcedar and Russian olive are now the third and fourth most frequently occurring woody riparian plants and the second and fifth most abundant species (out of 42 native and non-native species) along rivers in the western United States. Currently there is not a precise estimate of the areas that these species occupy in the entire West. Climatic variables are important determinants of their distribution and abundance. For example, saltcedar is limited by its sensitivity to hard freezes, whereas Russian olive appears to have a chilling requirement for bud break and seed germination, and can presumably survive colder winter temperatures. Either species can be dominant, co-dominant or sub-dominant relative to native species on a given river system. A number of environmental factors such as water availability, soil salinity, degree of streamflow regulation, and fire frequency can influence the abundance of these species relative to native species. Numerous studies suggest that both species have spread on western rivers primarily through a replacement process, whereby stress-tolerant species have moved into expanded niches that are no longer suitable for mesic native pioneer species. Better maps of current distribution and rigorous monitoring of distributional changes though time can help to resolve differences in predictions of potential future spread. An adequate understanding does not yet exist of what fraction of western riparian zones is resistant to dominance by either of these species, what fraction is at risk and could benefit from intervention, and what fraction has been altered to the point that saltcedar or Russian olive are most likely to thrive.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70118759</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Friedel, Michael J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A data-driven approach for modeling post-fire debris-flow volumes and their uncertainty</title><secondary-title>Environmental Modelling and Software</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Modelling and Software</full-title></periodical><pages>1583-1598</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Debris-flow volume</keyword><keyword>Genetic programming</keyword><keyword>Multivariate</keyword><keyword>Nonlinear models</keyword><keyword>Nonlinear uncertainty</keyword><keyword>Prediction</keyword><keyword>Self-organizing map</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.envsoft.2011.07.014</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This study demonstrates the novel application of genetic programming to evolve nonlinear post-fire debris-flow volume equations from variables associated with a data-driven conceptual model of the western United States. The search space is constrained using a multi-component objective function that simultaneously minimizes root-mean squared and unit errors for the evolution of fittest equations. An optimization technique is then used to estimate the limits of nonlinear prediction uncertainty associated with the debris-flow equations. In contrast to a published multiple linear regression three-variable equation, linking basin area with slopes greater or equal to 30 percent, burn severity characterized as area burned moderate plus high, and total storm rainfall, the data-driven approach discovers many nonlinear and several dimensionally consistent equations that are unbiased and have less prediction uncertainty. Of the nonlinear equations, the best performance (lowest prediction uncertainty) is achieved when using three variables: average basin slope, total burned area, and total storm rainfall. Further reduction in uncertainty is possible for the nonlinear equations when dimensional consistency is not a priority and by subsequently applying a gradient solver to the fittest solutions. The data-driven modeling approach can be applied to nonlinear multivariate problems in all fields of study. © 2011.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032678</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yamaura, Yuichi</author><author>Andrew Royle, J.</author><author>Kuboi, Kouji</author><author>Tada, Tsuneo</author><author>Ikeno, Susumu</author><author>Makino, Shun'ichi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modelling community dynamics based on species-level abundance models from detection/nondetection data</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>67-75</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Monitoring</keyword><keyword>Data augmentation</keyword><keyword>Detectability</keyword><keyword>Detection/nondetection data</keyword><keyword>Functional group</keyword><keyword>Hierarchical Bayesian modelling</keyword><keyword>Presence/absence data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0021-8901</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01922.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>1. In large-scale field surveys, a binary recording of each species’ detection or nondetection has been increasingly adopted for its simplicity and low cost. Because of the importance of abundance in many studies, it is desirable to obtain inferences about abundance at species-, functional group-, and community-levels fromsuch binary data. 2. We developed a novel hierarchical multi-species abundance model based on species-level detec- tion⁄nondetection data. The model accounts for the existence of undetected species, and variability in abundance and detectabilityamong species. Species-level detection⁄nondetection is linked to spe- cies-level abundance via a detection model that accommodates the expectation that probability of detection (at least one individuals is detected) increases with local abundance of the species. We applied this model to a 9-year dataset composed of the detection⁄nondetection of forest birds, at a single post-fire site (from7 to 15 years after fire) in amontane area of central Japan.Themodel allo- cated undetected species into one of the predefined functional groups by assuming a prior distribu- tion on individual group membership. 3. The results suggest that 15–20 species were missed in each year, and that species richness of com- munities and functional groups did not change with post-fire forest succession. Overall abundance of birds and abundance of functional groups tended to increase over time, although only in the win- ter,while decreases in detectabilitieswere observed in several species. 4. Synthesis and applications. Understanding and prediction of large-scale biodiversity dynamics partly hinge on how we can use data effectively. Our hierarchical model for detection⁄nondetection data estimates abundance in space ⁄ time at species-, functional group-, and community-levels while accounting for undetected individuals and species. It also permits comparison ofmultiple communi- ties bymany types of abundance-based diversity and similaritymeasures under imperfect detection.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70003684</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hovick, Torre J.</author><author>miller, James R.</author><author>Koford, Rolf R.</author><author>Engle, David M.</author><author>Debinski, Diane M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Postfledging Survival of Grasshopper Sparrows in Grasslands Managed with Fire and Grazing</title><secondary-title>The Condor</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Condor</full-title></periodical><pages>429-437</pages><volume>113</volume><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0010-5422</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1525/cond.2011.100135</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Abstract. More accurate estimates of survival after nestlings fledge are needed for population models to be parameterized and population dynamics to be understood during this vulnerable life stage. The period after fledging is the time when chicks learn to fly, forage, and hide from predators. We monitored postfledging survival, causespecific mortality, and movements of Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) in grassland managed with fire and grazing. In 2009, we attached radio transmitters to 50 nestlings from 50 different broods and modeled their survival in response to climatic, biological, and ecological variables. There was no effect of treatment on survival. The factor most influencing postfledging survival was age; no other variable was significant.

The date of publication is found to be 1861, rather than 1863. Only one of the three original cotypes exists, and it is designated as the lectotype of the species. Another cotype is found to have been destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and subsequent fire. The third is lost. The lectotype is genetically confirmed to be from California, and not Arizona, USA as sometimes reported. Maternally, the holotype of Gopherus lepidocephalus (Ottley &amp; Velázques Solis. 1989) from the Cape Region of Baja California Sur, Mexico is also from the Mojavian population of the desert tortoise, and not from Tiburon Island, Sonora, Mexico as previously proposed. A suite of characters serve to diagnose tortoises west and north of the Colorado River, the Mojavian population, from those east and south of the river in Arizona, USA, and Sonora and Sinaloa, Mexico, the Sonoran population. Species recognition is warranted and because Gopherus lepidocephalus is from the Mojavian population, no names are available for the Sonoran species. Thus, a new species, Gopherus morafkaisp. n., is named and this action reduces the distribution of Gopherus agassizii to only 30% of its former range. This reduction has important implications for the conservation and protection of Gopherus agassizii, which may deserve a higher level of protection.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70005649</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keeley, Jon E</author><author>Bond, William J</author><author>Bradstock, Ross A</author><author>Pausas, Juli G</author><author>Rundel, Philip W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Climate, Fire and Geology in the Convergence of Mediterranean-type Climate Ecosystems</title><secondary-title>Fire in mediterranean ecosystems: Ecology, evolution and management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Fire in mediterranean ecosystems: Ecology, evolution and management</full-title></periodical><pages>388-397</pages><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Cambridge, UK</pub-location><publisher>Cambridge University Press</publisher><isbn>978-1-139-03309-1</isbn><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70007257</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stoleson, Scott H.</author><author>King, David I.</author><author>Tomosy, Monica</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Avian research on U.S. Forest Service Experimental Forests and Ranges: Emergent themes, opportunities, and challenges</title><secondary-title>Forest Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forest Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>49-52</pages><volume>262</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Experimental Forests and Ranges</keyword><keyword>Ornithology</keyword><keyword>Research opportunities</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0378-1127</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.foreco.2010.07.038</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Since 1908, U.S. Forest Service Experimental Forests and Ranges have been dedicated to long-term interdisciplinary research on a variety of ecological and management questions. They encompass a wide diversity of life zones and ecoregions, and provide access to research infrastructure, opportunities for controlled manipulations, and integration with other types of long-term data. These features have facilitated important advances in a number of areas of avian research, including furthering our understanding of population dynamics, the effects of forest management on birds, avian responses to disturbances such as fire and hurricanes, and other aspects of avian ecology and conservation. However, despite these contributions, this invaluable resource has been underutilized by ornithologists. Most of the Experimental Forests and Ranges have had no ornithological work done on them. We encourage the ornithological community, especially graduate students and new faculty, to take advantage of this largely untapped potential for long-term work, linkage with long-term data sets, multiple disciplines, and active forest management. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70036526</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rykhus, Russell</author><author>Lu, Zhong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Monitoring a boreal wildfire using multi-temporal Radarsat-1 intensity and coherence images</title><secondary-title>Geomatics, Natural Hazards and Risk</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geomatics, Natural Hazards and Risk</full-title></periodical><pages>15-32</pages><volume>2</volume><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/19475705.2010.532971</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Twenty-five C-band Radarsat-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired from the summer of 2002 to the summer of 2005 are used to map a 2003 boreal wildfire (B346) in the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska under conditions of near-persistent cloud cover. Our analysis is primarily based on the 15 SAR scenes acquired during arctic growing seasons. The Radarsat-1 intensity data are used to map the onset and progression of the fire, and interferometric coherence images are used to qualify burn severity and monitor post-fire recovery. We base our analysis of the fire on three test sites, two from within the fire and one unburned site. The B346 fire increased backscattered intensity values for the two burn study sites by approximately 5–6 dB and substantially reduced coherence from background levels of approximately 0.8 in unburned background forested areas to approximately 0.2 in the burned area. Using ancillary vegetation information from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and information on burn severity from Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) data, we conclude that burn site 2 was more severely burned than burn site 1 and that C-band interferometric coherence data are useful for mapping landscape changes due to fire. Differences in burn severity and topography are determined to be the likely reasons for the observed differences in post-fire intensity and coherence trends between burn sites.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70035952</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Holcombe, Tracy R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Buffelgrass-Integrated modeling of an invasive plant</title></titles><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2011-3022</isbn><language>ENGLISH</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/fs20113022</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Johnson, Joshua B.</author><author>Edwards, John W.</author><author>Ford, W.

We modeled fire severity conditions for the entire area burned in large fires during a large fire year (2004) to determine the factors that are most important in estimating severity and to identify areas affected by deep-burning fires. In addition to standard methods of assessing severity using spectral information, we incorporated information regarding topography, spatial pattern of burning, and instantaneous characteristics such as fire weather and fire radiative power. Ensemble techniques using regression trees as a base learner were able to determine fire severity successfully using spectral data in concert with other relevant geospatial data. This method was successful in estimating average conditions, but it underestimated the range of severity. This new approach was used to identify black spruce stands that experienced intermediate- to high-severity fires in 2004 and are therefore susceptible to a shift in regrowth toward deciduous dominance or mixed dominance. Based on the output of the severity model, we estimate that 39% (approximately 4000 km2) of all burned black spruce stands in 2004 had &lt;10 cm of residual organic layer and may be susceptible a postfire shift in plant functional type dominance, as well as permafrost loss. If the fraction of area susceptible to deciduous regeneration is constant for large fire years, the effect of such years in the most recent decade has been to reduce black spruce stands by 4.2% and to increase areas dominated or co-dominated by deciduous forest stands by 20%. Such disturbance-driven modifications have the potential to affect the carbon cycle and climate system at regional to global scales.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70034421</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Burton, Jesse A.</author><author>Hallgren, Stephen W.</author><author>Fuhlendorf, Samuel D.</author><author>Leslie, David M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Understory response to varying fire frequencies after 20 years of prescribed burning in an upland oak forest</title><secondary-title>Plant Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Plant Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>1513-1525</pages><volume>212</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Species richness</keyword><keyword>Fire frequency</keyword><keyword>Foliar cover</keyword><keyword>Herbaceous plants</keyword><keyword>Understory diversity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1385-0237</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11258-011-9926-y</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Ecosystems in the eastern United States that were shaped by fire over thousands of years of anthropogenic burning recently have been subjected to fire suppression resulting in significant changes in vegetation composition and structure and encroachment by invasive species. Renewed interest in use of fire to manage such ecosystems will require knowledge of effects of fire regime on vegetation. We studied the effects of one aspect of the fire regime, fire frequency, on biomass, cover and diversity of understory vegetation in upland oak forests prescribe-burned for 20 years at different frequencies ranging from zero to five fires per decade. Overstory canopy closure ranged from 88 to 96% and was not affected by fire frequency indicating high tolerance of large trees for even the most frequent burning. Understory species richness and cover was dominated by woody reproduction followed in descending order by forbs, C3 graminoids, C4 grasses, and legumes. Woody plant understory cover did not change with fire frequency and increased 30% from one to three years after a burn. Both forbs and C3 graminoids showed a linear increase in species richness and cover as fire frequency increased. In contrast, C4 grasses and legumes did not show a response to fire frequency. The reduction of litter by fire may have encouraged regeneration of herbaceous plants and helped explain the positive response of forbs and C3 graminoids to increasing fire frequency. Our results showed that herbaceous biomass, cover, and diversity can be managed with long-term prescribed fire under the closed canopy of upland oak forests.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70034365</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Belnap, Jayne</author><author>Campbell, Donald</author><author>Kershner, Jeff</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Upper Colorado River Basin Climate Effects Network</title></titles><pages>2-2</pages><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2010-3092</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/fs20103092</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cross, Alison</author><author>Perakis, Steven S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tree species and soil nutrient profiles in old-growth forests of the Oregon Coast Range</title><secondary-title>Canadian Journal of Forest Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canadian Journal of Forest Research</full-title></periodical><pages>195-210</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0045-5067\n1208-6037</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/X10-199</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest provide a unique opportunity to examine tree species – soil rela- tionships in ecosystems that have developed without significant human disturbance. We characterized foliage, forest floor, and mineral soil nutrients associated with four canopy tree species (Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.), western redcedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don), and bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum Pursh)) in eight old-growth forests of the Oregon Coast Range. The greatest forest floor accumula- tions of C, N, P, Ca, Mg, and K occurred under Douglas-fir, primarily due to greater forest floor mass. In mineral soil, western hemlock exhibited significantly lower Ca concentration and sum of cations (Ca + Mg + K) than bigleaf maple, with intermediate values for Douglas-fir and western redcedar. Bigleaf maple explained most species-based differences in foliar nutrients, displaying high concentrations of N, P, Ca, Mg, and K. Foliar P and N:P variations largely reflected soil P variation across sites. The four tree species that we examined exhibited a number of individualistic effects on soil nutrient levels that contribute to biogeochemical heterogeneity in these ecosystems. Where fire suppression and long-term succes- sion favor dominance by highly shade-tolerant western hemlock, our results suggest a potential for declines in both soil Ca availability and soil biogeochemical heterogeneity in old-growth forests.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/X10-199</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Winter, Stephen L.</author><author>Fuhlendorf, Samuel D.</author><author>Goad, Carla L.</author><author>Davis, Craig A.</author><author>Hickman, Karen R.</author><author>Leslie, David M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fire tolerance of a resprouting Artemisia (Asteraceae) shrub</title><secondary-title>Plant Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Plant Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>2085-2094</pages><volume>212</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Prescribed fire</keyword><keyword>Density</keyword><keyword>Disturbance ecology</keyword><keyword>Ecosystem maintenance</keyword><keyword>Fire-dependent</keyword><keyword>Fire-influenced</keyword><keyword>Vegetation structure</keyword><keyword>Woody plant</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1385-0237</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11258-011-9975-2</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In North America, most Artemisia (Asteraceae) shrub species lack the ability to resprout after disturbances that remove aboveground biomass. We studied the response of one of the few resprouting Artemisia shrubs, Artemisia filifolia (sand sagebrush), to the effects of prescribed fires. We collected data on A. filifolia density and structural characteristics (height, canopy area, and canopy volume) in an A. filifolia shrubland in the southern Great Plains of North America. Our study sites included areas that had not been treated with prescribed fire, areas that had been treated with only one prescribed fire within the previous 5 years, and areas that had been treated with two prescribed fires within the previous 10 years. Our data were collected at time periods ranging from 1/2 to 5 years after the prescribed fires. Density of A. filifolia was not affected by one or two fires. Structural characteristics, although initially altered by prescribed fire, recovered to levels characteristic of unburned areas in 3-4 years after those fires. In contrast to most non-sprouting North American Artemisia shrub species, our research suggested that the resprouting A. filifolia is highly tolerant to the effects of fire. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032395</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lovich, Jeffrey E.</author><author>Ennen, Joshua R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Wildlife Conservation and Solar Energy Development in the Desert Southwest, United States</title><secondary-title>BioScience</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BioScience</full-title></periodical><pages>982-992</pages><volume>61</volume><issue>12</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>00063568\r15253244</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1525/bio.2011.61.12.8</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Large areas of public land are currently being permitted or evaluated for utility-scale solar energy development (USSED) in the southwestern United States, including areas with high biodiversity and protected species.

However, prescribed fire remains controversial for some grassland managers because of reported reductions in bird use of recently burned grasslands. Few studies have evaluated effects of fire on grassland bird populations in the northern mixed-grass prairie region. Fewer studies yet have examined the influence of fire on nest density or survival. In our review, we found no studies that simultaneously examined effects of fire on duck and passerine nesting. During 1998-2003, we examined effects of prescribed fire on the density of upland-nesting ducks and passerines nesting in north-central North Dakota, USA. Apparent nest densities of gadwall (Anas strepera), mallard (A. platyrhynchos), and all duck species combined, were influenced by fire history of study units, although the degree of influence was not compelling. Fire history was not related to nest densities of blue-winged teal (A. discors), northern shoveler (A. clypeata), or northern pintail (A. acuta); however, apparent nest densities in relation to the number of postfire growing seasons exhibited a strikingly similar pattern among all duck species. When compared to ducks, fire history strongly influenced apparent nest densities of clay-colored sparrow (Spizella pallida), Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), and bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus). For most species examined, apparent nest densities were lowest in recently burned units, increased during the second postfire growing season, and stabilized or, in some cases, decreased thereafter. Prescribed fire is critical for restoring the ecology of northern mixed-grass prairies and our findings indicate that reductions in nest densities are limited mostly to the first growing season after fire. Our results support the premise that upland-nesting ducks and several grassland passerine species are adapted to periodic fires occurring at a frequency similar to that of pre-Euro-American settlement of the region. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70039329</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Miller, Mark W.</author><author>Pearlstine, Elise V.</author><author>Dorazio, Robert M.</author><author>Mazzotti, Frank J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Occupancy and abundance of wintering birds in a dynamic agricultural landscape</title><secondary-title>Journal of Wildlife Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Wildlife Management</full-title></periodical><pages>751-761</pages><volume>75</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Common yellowthroat</keyword><keyword>Edge effects</keyword><keyword>Everglades agricultural area</keyword><keyword>Palm warbler</keyword><keyword>Point counts</keyword><keyword>Site occupancy</keyword><keyword>Sugarcane</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-541X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jwmg.97</electronic-resource-num><abstract>ABSTRACT Assessing wildlife management action requiresmonitoring populations, and abundance often is the parameter monitored. Recent methodological advances have enabled estimation of mean abundance within a habitat using presence–absence or count data obtained via repeated visits to a sample of sites. These methods assume populations are closed and intuitively assume habitats within sites change little during a field season. However, many habitats are highly variable over short periods. We developed a variation of existing occupancy and abundance models that allows for extreme spatio-temporal differences in habitat, and resulting changes in wildlife abundance, among sites and among visits to a site within a field season. We conducted our study in sugarcane habitat within the Everglades Agricultural Area southeast of Lake Okeechobee in south Florida. We counted wintering birds, primarily passerines, within 245 sites usually 5 times at each site during December 2006–March 2007. We estimated occupancy and mean abundance of birds in 6 vegetation states during the sugarcane harvest and allowed these parameters to vary temporally or spatially within a vegetation state. Occupancy and mean abundance of the common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas) was affected by structure of sugarcane and uncultivated edge vegetation (occupancy ¼ 1.00 [95%C_ vegetation versus 0.20 [95%C_ I ¼ 0.96–1.00] and mean abundance ¼ 7.9 [95%C_ I ¼ 0.04–0.71] and 0.22 [95%C_I ¼ 3.2–19.5] in tall sugarcane with tall edge I ¼ 0.04–1.2], respectively, in short sugar- cane with short edge vegetation in one half of the study area). Occupancy and mean abundance of palm warblers (Dendroica palmarum) were constant (occupancy ¼ 1.00, 95%C_ abundance ¼ 18, 95%C_ I ¼ 0.69–1.00; mean I ¼ 1–270). Our model may enable wildlife managers to assess rigorously effects of future edge habitat management on avian distribution and abundance within agricultural landscapes during winter or the breeding season. The model may also help wildlife managers make similar management decisions involving other dynamic habitats such as wetlands, prairies, and even forested areas if forest management or fires occur during the field season.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70005283</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shoemaker, B</author><author>Lopez, Cd</author><author>Duever, Mj</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evapotranspiration over spatially extensive plant communities in the Big Cypress National Preserve, Southern Florida, 2007–2010</title></titles><pages>46-46</pages><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2011-5212</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2011/5212/</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cordova, Carlos E.</author><author>Johnson, William C.</author><author>Mandel, Rolfe D.</author><author>Palmer, Michael W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Late Quaternary environmental change inferred from phytoliths and other soil-related proxies: Case studies from the central and southern Great Plains, USA</title><secondary-title>Catena</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Catena</full-title></periodical><pages>87-108</pages><volume>85</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Charcoal</keyword><keyword>Great Plains</keyword><keyword>Opal phytoliths</keyword><keyword>Paleosols</keyword><keyword>Sporormiella</keyword><keyword>Stable carbon isotopes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0341-8162</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.catena.2010.08.015</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This study investigates stable carbon isotopes (δ13C), opal phytolith assemblages, burnt phytoliths, microscopic charcoal and Sporormiella spores from modern soils and paleosols in Kansas and Oklahoma. Grass and dicot phytoliths in combination with δ13C are used as proxies for reconstructing the structure of grasslands and woodlands. Burnt grass phytoliths and microscopic charcoal are evaluated as proxies for reconstructing paleofire incidence. Concentrations of the fungal spore Sporormiella are used as a proxy for assessing large herbivore activity. These proxies were tested on various modern grassland communities of the central and southern Great Plains, including areas with bison, cattle, and small herbivores, and areas under different fire frequencies.Opal phytolith assemblages and δ13C values show that before cal 11ka, C3 grasses and woody plants predominated in areas that today are dominated by C4 grasses. The origin of the shortgrass prairie dates back to about cal 10ka. The origin of the tallgrass prairie, however, is not clear as phytolith data show variable assemblages throughout the Holocene (mixed-grass, tallgrass, and tallgrass-woodland mosaic). Different proxies (burnt phytoliths vs. charcoal) reveal different fire frequencies, but it is apparent that microfossil evidence for fire incidence is closely related to the abundance of woody plants in the landscape.Before cal 12. ka, soils show somewhat elevated concentration of Sporormiella, but lower concentrations than the modern high-density bison and cattle grazing areas. Throughout the Holocene, Sporormiella frequencies are low, which suggests lower large ungulate densities and perhaps high mobility. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70035026</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Romme, William H.</author><author>Boyce, Mark S.</author><author>Gresswell, Robert</author><author>Merrill, Evelyn H.</author><author>Minshall, G.

At the time of the fires, little was known about the impacts of such a large severe disturbance because scientists had had few previous opportunities to study such an event. Ecologists predicted short- and long-term effects of the 1988 fires on vegetation, biogeochemistry, primary productivity, wildlife, and aquatic ecosystems based on scientific understanding of the time. Twenty-plus years of subsequent study allow these early predictions to be evaluated. Most of the original predictions were at least partially supported, but some predictions were refuted, others nuanced, and a few postfire phenomena were entirely unexpected. Post-1988 Yellowstone studies catalyzed advances in ecology focused on the importance of spatial and temporal heterogeneity, contingent influences, and multiple interacting drivers. Post-1988 research in Yellowstone also has changed public perceptions of fire as an ecological process and attitudes towards fire management. Looking ahead to projected climate change and more frequent large fires, the well-documented ecological responses to the 1988 Yellowstone fires provide a foundation for detecting and evaluating potential changes in fire regimes of temperate mountainous regions.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70034247</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fraver, Shawn</author><author>Jain, Theresa</author><author>Bradford, John B.</author><author>D'amato, Anthony W.</author><author>Kastendick, Doug</author><author>Palik, Brian</author><author>Shinneman, Doug</author><author>Stanovick, John</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The efficacy of salvage logging in reducing subsequent fire severity in conifer-dominated forests of Minnesota, USA</title><secondary-title>Ecological Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>1895-1901</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Minnesota</keyword><keyword>Fire behavior</keyword><keyword>Blowdown</keyword><keyword>Fuel reduction treatments</keyword><keyword>Ham Lake fire</keyword><keyword>Multiple disturbances</keyword><keyword>Pinus banksiana</keyword><keyword>Superior National Forest</keyword><keyword>USA</keyword><keyword>Wildfire intensity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1051-0761</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1890/11-0380.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Although primarily used to mitigate economic losses following disturbance, salvage logging has also been justified on the basis of reducing fire risk and fire severity; however, its ability to achieve these secondary objectives remains unclear. The patchiness resulting from a sequence of recent disturbances—blowdown, salvage logging, and wildfire— provided an excellent opportunity to assess the impacts of blowdown and salvage logging on wildfire severity. We used two fire-severity assessments (tree-crown and forest-floor characteristics) to compare post-wildfire conditions among three treatment combinations (Blowdown–Salvage–Fire, Blowdown–Fire, and Fire only). Our results suggest that salvage logging reduced the intensity (heat released) of the subsequent fire. However, its effect on severity (impact to the system) differed between the tree crowns and forest floor: tree-crown indices suggest that salvage logging decreased fire severity (albeit with modest statistical support), while forest-floor indices suggest that salvage logging increased fire severity. We attribute the latter finding to the greater exposure of mineral soil caused by logging operations; once exposed, soils are more likely to register the damaging effects of fire, even if fire intensity is not extreme. These results highlight the important distinction between fire intensity and severity when formulating post-disturbance management prescriptions.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70034664</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Manies, K L</author><author>Harden, J W</author><author>Ottmar, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Soils Data Related to the 1999 FROSTFIRE Burn</title></titles><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2011-1216</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20111216</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author><author>Franklin, Janet</author><author>D’Antonio, Carla</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>McKenzie, et al.

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have specified requirements to systematically observe atmosphere, ocean, and land characteristics, or Essential Climate Variables (ECVs). The Global Climate Observing System has developed formal specifications for ECVs that are technically and economically feasible for systematic ECV observation. Fire Disturbance is one of the 14 Terrestrial ECVs, and is defined as "burned area" supplemented by "active fires" and "fire radiated power" (FRP) measurements. Landsat's temporal resolution and sensor characteristics make it suitable for mapping burned area, but not suitable for monitoring active fires or FRP. In this paper, we describe the development of a database for calibration, verification, and validation of a Landsat-based burned area ECV, along with the algorithms to be tested against that database.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70048349</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cannon, Susan H</author><author>Michael, John A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Emergency Assessment of Postwildfire Debris-Flow Hazards for the 2011 Motor Fire , Sierra and Stanislaus National Forests , California</title></titles><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2011-1251</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20111251</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thode, Andrea E.</author><author>Van Wagtendonk, Jan W.</author><author>Miller, Jay D.</author><author>Quinn, James F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantifying the fire regime distributions for severity in Yosemite National Park, California, USA</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</full-title></periodical><pages>223-239</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Landsat</keyword><keyword>RdNBR</keyword><keyword>Sierra Nevada</keyword><keyword>dNBR</keyword><keyword>burn severity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1049-8001</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1071/WF09060</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper quantifies current fire severity distributions for 19 different fire-regime types in Yosemite National Park, California, USA. Landsat Thematic Mapper remote sensing data are used to map burn severity for 99 fires (cumulatively over 97 000 ha) that burned in Yosemite over a 20-year period. These maps are used to quantify the frequency distributions of fire severity by fire-regime type. A classification is created for the resultant distributions and they are discussed within the context of four vegetation zones: the foothill shrub and woodland zone; the lower montane forest zone; the upper montane forest zone and the subalpine forest zone. The severity distributions can form a building block from which to discuss current fire regimes across the Sierra Nevada in California. This work establishes a framework for comparing the effects of current fires on our landscapes with our notions of how fires historically burned, and how current fire severity distributions differ from our desired future conditions. As this process is refined, a new set of information will be available to researchers and land managers to help understand how fire regimes have changed from the past and how we might attempt to manage them in the future.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70003910</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liang, Christina T.</author><author>Stohlgren, Thomas J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Habitat suitability of patch types: A case study of the Yosemite toad</title><secondary-title>Frontiers of Earth Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers of Earth Science</full-title></periodical><pages>217-228</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Anaxyrus canorus</keyword><keyword>Bufo canorus</keyword><keyword>habitat patch</keyword><keyword>Maxent</keyword><keyword>patchy populations</keyword><keyword>species distribution models</keyword><keyword>Yosemite toad</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2095-0195 2095-0209</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11707-011-0157-2</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Understanding patch variability is crucial in understanding the spatial population structure of wildlife species, especially for rare or threatened species. We used a well-tested maximum entropy species distribution model (Maxent) to map the Yosemite toad (Anaxyrus (= Bufo) canorus) in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. Twenty-six environmental variables were included in the model representing climate, topography, land cover type, and disturbance factors (e.g., distances to agricultural lands, fire perimeters, and timber harvest areas) throughout the historic range of the toad. We then took a novel approach to the study of spatially structured populations by applying the species-environmental matching model separately for 49 consistently occupied sites of the Yosemite toad compared to 27 intermittently occupied sites. We found that the distribution of the entire population was highly predictable (AUC = 0.95±0.03 SD), and associated with low slopes, specific vegetation types (wet meadow, alpine-dwarf shrub, montane chaparral, red fir, and subalpine conifer), and warm temperatures. The consistently occupied sites were also associated with these same factors, and they were also highly predictable (AUC = 0.95±0.05 SD). However, the intermittently occupied sites were associated with distance to fire perimeter, a slightly different response to vegetation types, distance to timber harvests, and a much broader set of aspect classes (AUC = 0.90±0.11 SD). We conclude that many studies of species distributions may benefit by modeling spatially structured populations separately. Modeling and monitoring consistently-occupied sites may provide a realistic snapshot of current species-environment relationships, important climatic and topographic patterns associated with species persistence patterns, and an understanding of the plasticity of the species to respond to varying climate regimes across its range. Meanwhile, modeling and monitoring of widely dispersing individuals and intermittently occupied sites may uncover environmental thresholds and human-related threats to population persistence.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70118611</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>O'Donnell, J.

Using a combination of field measurements, numerical modeling of soil thermal dynamics, and mass-balance modeling of OC dynamics, we tested the sensitivity of soil OC storage to a suite of individual climate factors (air temperature, soil moisture, and snow depth) and fire severity. We also conducted sensitivity analyses to explore the combined effects of fire-soil moisture interactions and snow seasonality on OC storage. OC losses were calculated as the difference in OC stocks after three fire cycles (similar to 500 yr) following a prescribed step-change in climate and/or fire. Across single-factor scenarios, our findings indicate that warmer air temperatures resulted in the largest relative soil OC losses (similar to 5.3 kg C m(-2)), whereas dry soil conditions alone (in the absence of wildfire) resulted in the smallest carbon losses (similar to 0.1 kg C m(-2)). Increased fire severity resulted in carbon loss of similar to 3.3 kg C m(-2), whereas changes in snow depth resulted in smaller OC losses (2.1-2.2 kg C m(-2)). Across multiple climate factors, we observed larger OC losses than for single-factor scenarios. For instance, high fire severity regime associated with warmer and drier conditions resulted in OC losses of similar to 6.1 kg C m(-2), whereas a low fire severity regime associated with warmer and wetter conditions resulted in OC losses of similar to 5.6 kg C m(-2). A longer snow-free season associated with future warming resulted in OC losses of similar to 5.4 kg C m(-2). Soil climate was the dominant control on soil OC loss, governing the sensitivity of microbial decomposers to fluctuations in temperature and soil moisture; this control, in turn, is governed by interannual changes in active layer depth. Transitional responses of the active layer depth to fire regimes also contributed to OC losses, primarily by determining the proportion of OC into frozen and unfrozen soil layers.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70036305</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>D'Amato, Anthony W.</author><author>Fraver, Shawn</author><author>Palik, Brian J.</author><author>Bradford, John B.</author><author>Patty, Laura</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Singular and interactive effects of blowdown, salvage logging, and wildfire in sub-boreal pine systems</title><secondary-title>Forest Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forest Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>2070-2078</pages><volume>262</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Salvage logging</keyword><keyword>Pinus banksiana</keyword><keyword>Biological legacies</keyword><keyword>Compound disturbances</keyword><keyword>Wild fire</keyword><keyword>Wind disturbance</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0378-1127</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.foreco.2011.09.003</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The role of disturbance in structuring vegetation is widely recognized; however, we are only beginning to understand the effects of multiple interacting disturbances on ecosystem recovery and development. Of particular interest is the impact of post-disturbance management interventions, particularly in light of the global controversy surrounding the effects of salvage logging on forest ecosystem recovery. Studies of salvage logging impacts have focused on the effects of post-disturbance salvage logging within the context of a single natural disturbance event. There have been no formal evaluations of how these effects may differ when followed in short sequence by a second, high severity natural disturbance. To evaluate the impact of this management practice within the context of multiple disturbances, we examined the structural and woody plant community responses of sub-boreal Pinus banksiana systems to a rapid sequence of disturbances. Specifically, we compared responses to Blowdown (B), Fire (F), Blowdown-Fire, and Blowdown-Salvage-Fire (BSF) and compared these to undisturbed control (C) stands. Comparisons between BF and BSF indicated that the primary effect of salvage logging was a decrease in the abundance of structural legacies, such as downed woody debris and snags. Both of these compound disturbance sequences (BF and BSF), resulted in similar woody plant communities, largely dominated by Populus tremuloides; however, there was greater homogeneity in community composition in salvage logged areas. Areas experiencing solely fire (F stands) were dominated by P. banksiana regeneration, and blowdown areas (B stands) were largely characterized by regeneration from shade tolerant conifer species. Our results suggest that salvage logging impacts on woody plant communities are diminished when followed by a second high severity disturbance; however, impacts on structural legacies persist. Provisions for the retention of snags, downed logs, and surviving trees as part of salvage logging operations will minimize these structural impacts and may allow for greater ecosystem recovery following these disturbance combinations. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70034544</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lovich, Jeffrey E.</author><author>Ennen, Joshua R.</author><author>Madrak, Sheila V.</author><author>Loughran, Caleb L.</author><author>Meyer, Katherin P.</author><author>Arundel, Terence R.</author><author>Bjurlin, Curtis D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Long-term post-fire effects on spatial ecology and reproductive output of female Agassiz's desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) at a wind energy facility near Palm Springs, California, USA</title><secondary-title>Fire Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Fire Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>75-87</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire effects</keyword><keyword>Reproduction</keyword><keyword>California</keyword><keyword>Agassiz's desert tortoise</keyword><keyword>Gopherus agassizii</keyword><keyword>Movement</keyword><keyword>Sonoran desert</keyword><keyword>Wind energy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.4996/fireecology.0703075</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We studied the long-term response of a cohort of eight female Agassiz's desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) during the first 15 years following a large fire at a wind energy generation facility near Palm Springs, California, USA. The fire burned a significant portion of the study site in 1995. Tortoise activity areas were mapped using minimum convex polygons for a proximate post-fire interval from 1997 to 2000, and a long-term post-fire interval from 2009 to 2010. In addition, we measured the annual reproductive output of eggs each year and monitored the body condition of tortoises over time. One adult female tortoise was killed by the fire and five tortoises bore exposure scars that were not fatal. Despite predictions that tortoises would make the short-distance movements from burned to nearby unburned habitats, most activity areas and their centroids remained in burned areas for the duration of the study. The percentage of activity area burned did not differ significantly between the two monitoring periods. Annual reproductive output and measures of body condition remained statistically similar throughout the monitoring period. Despite changes in plant composition, conditions at this site appeared to be suitable for survival of tortoises following a major fire. High productivity at the site may have buffered tortoises from the adverse impacts of fire if they were not killed outright. Tortoise populations at less productive desert sites may not have adequate resources to sustain normal activity areas, reproductive output, and body conditions following fire.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70041625</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Perakis, Steven S.</author><author>Sinkhorn, Emily R.</author><author>Compton, Jana E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>δ15N constraints on long-term nitrogen balances in temperate forests</title><secondary-title>Oecologia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oecologia</full-title></periodical><pages>793-807</pages><volume>167</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Soil</keyword><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Denitrification</keyword><keyword>N2-fixation</keyword><keyword>Nitrate</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0029-8549</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00442-011-2016-y</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Biogeochemical theory emphasizes nitrogen (N) limitation and the many factors that can restrict N accumulation in temperate forests, yet lacks a working model of conditions that can promote naturally high N accumulation. We used a dynamic simulation model of ecosystem N and δ(15)N to evaluate which combination of N input and loss pathways could produce a range of high ecosystem N contents characteristic of forests in the Oregon Coast Range. Total ecosystem N at nine study sites ranged from 8,788 to 22,667 kg ha(-1) and carbon (C) ranged from 188 to 460 Mg ha(-1), with highest values near the coast. Ecosystem δ(15)N displayed a curvilinear relationship with ecosystem N content, and largely reflected mineral soil, which accounted for 96-98% of total ecosystem N. Model simulations of ecosystem N balances parameterized with field rates of N leaching required long-term average N inputs that exceed atmospheric deposition and asymbiotic and epiphytic N(2)-fixation, and that were consistent with cycles of post-fire N(2)-fixation by early-successional red alder. Soil water δ(15)NO(3)(-) patterns suggested a shift in relative N losses from denitrification to nitrate leaching as N accumulated, and simulations identified nitrate leaching as the primary N loss pathway that constrains maximum N accumulation. Whereas current theory emphasizes constraints on biological N(2)-fixation and disturbance-mediated N losses as factors that limit N accumulation in temperate forests, our results suggest that wildfire can foster substantial long-term N accumulation in ecosystems that are colonized by symbiotic N(2)-fixing vegetation.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70034567</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Goulden, M.

Live biomass (Clive) was low in the 1- and 6-year-old stands, and increased following a logistic pattern to high levels in the 74- and 154-year-old stands. Carbon stocks in the forest floor (Cforest floor) and coarse woody debris (CCWD) were comparatively high in the 1-year-old stand, reduced in the 6- through 40-year-old stands, and highest in the 74- and 154-year-old stands. Total net primary production (TNPP) was reduced in the 1- and 6-year-old stands, highest in the 23- through 74-year-old stands and somewhat reduced in the 154-year-old stand. The NPP decline at the 154-year-old stand was related to increased autotrophic respiration rather than decreased gross primary production (GPP). Net ecosystem production (NEP), calculated by integrated eddy covariance, indicated the 1- and 6-year-old stands were losing carbon, the 15-year-old stand was gaining a small amount of carbon, the 23- and 74-year-old stands were gaining considerable carbon, and the 40- and 154-year-old stands were gaining modest amounts of carbon. The recovery from fire was rapid; a linear fit through the NEP observations at the 6- and 15-year-old stands indicated the transition from carbon source to sink occurred within 11–12 years. The NEP decline at the 154-year-old stand appears related to increased losses from Clive by tree mortality and possibly from Cforest floor by decomposition. Our findings support the idea that NPP, carbon production efficiency (NPP/GPP), NEP, and carbon storage efficiency (NEP/TNPP) all decrease in old boreal stands.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70036112</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hossack, Blake R.</author><author>Pilliod, David S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Amphibian responses to wildfire in the western united states: Emerging patterns from short-term studies</title><secondary-title>Fire Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Fire Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>129-144</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire effects</keyword><keyword>Conservation</keyword><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Forest management</keyword><keyword>Amphibian</keyword><keyword>Decline</keyword><keyword>Fragmentation</keyword><keyword>Life history strategies</keyword><keyword>Population</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.4996/fireecology.0702129</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The increased frequency and severity of large wildfires in the western United States is an important ecological and management issue with direct relevance to amphibian conserva- tion. Although the knowledge of fire effects on amphibians in the region is still limited relative to most other vertebrate species, we reviewed the current literature to determine if there are evident patterns that might be informative for conservation or management strat- egies. Of the seven studies that compared pre- and post-wildfire data on a variety of met- rics, ranging from amphibian occupancy to body condition, two reported positive respons- es and five detected negative responses by at least one species. Another seven studies used a retrospective approach to compare effects of wildfire on populations: two studies reported positive effects, three reported negative effects from wildfire, and two reported no effects. All four studies that included plethodontid salamanders reported negative ef- fects on populations or individuals; these effects were greater in forests where fire had been suppressed and in areas that burned with high severity. Species that breed in streams are also vulnerable to post-wildfire changes in habitat, especially in the Southwest. Wild- fire is also important for maintaining suitable habitat for diverse amphibian communities, although those results may not be evident immediately after an area burns. We expect that wildfire will extirpate few healthy amphibian populations, but it is still unclear how popu- lations will respond to wildfire in the context of land management (including pre- and post-fire timber harvest) and fragmentation. Wildfire may also increase the risk of decline or extirpation for small, isolated, or stressed (e.g., from drought or disease) populations. Improved understanding of how these effects vary according to changes in fire frequency and severity are critical to form more effective conservation strategies for amphibians in the western United States.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70036126</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Soulard, Christopher E</author><author>Bogle, Rian C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using Terrestrial Light Detection and Ranging ( Lidar ) Technology for Land-Surface Analysis in the Southwest</title></titles><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2011-3017</isbn><abstract>Emerging technologies provide scientists with methods to measure Earth processes in new ways.

S. Endangered Species Act. Challenges to its successful management include the facts that much about its life history is unknown, its age at reproductive maturity is very advanced, certain life stages are practically unobservable, its productivity is responsive to unpredictable environmental events, and most of the known populations occur on private lands unprotected by any legal conservation instrument. One critical source of biological uncertainty is the degree to which fire promotes growth and reproductive response in the plant. To aid in its management, we developed a prototype population-level state-dependent decision-making framework that explicitly accounts for this uncertainty and for uncertainties related to stochastic environmental effects and vital rates. To parameterize the decision model, we used estimates found in the literature, and we analyzed data from a long-term monitoring program where fates of individual plants were observed through time. We demonstrate that different optimal courses of action are followed according to how one believes that fire influences reproductive response, and we show that the action taken for certain population states is informative for resolving uncertainty about competing beliefs regarding the effect of fire. We advocate the use of a model-predictive approach for the management of rare populations, particularly when management uncertainty is profound. Over time, an adaptive management approach should reduce uncertainty and improve management performance as predictions of management outcome generated under competing models are continually informed and updated by monitoring data.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.fwspubs.org/doi/abs/10.3996/012011-JFWM-007</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bar Massada, Avi</author><author>Syphard, Alexandra D.</author><author>Hawbaker, Todd J.</author><author>Stewart, Susan I.</author><author>Radeloff, Volker C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of ignition location models on the burn patterns of simulated wildfires</title><secondary-title>Environmental Modelling and Software</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Modelling and Software</full-title></periodical><pages>583-592</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>FARSITE</keyword><keyword>Burn probability</keyword><keyword>Ignition</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1364-8152</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.envsoft.2010.11.016</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fire simulation studies that use models such as FARSITE often assume that ignition locations are distributed randomly, because spatially explicit information about actual ignition locations are difficult to obtain. However, many studies show that the spatial distribution of ignition locations, whether human-caused or natural, is non-random. Thus, predictions from fire simulations based on random ignitions may be unrealistic. However, the extent to which the assumption of ignition location affects the predictions of fire simulation models has never been systematically explored. Our goal was to assess the difference in fire simulations that are based on random versus non-random ignition location patterns. We conducted four sets of 6000 FARSITE simulations for the Santa Monica Mountains in California to quantify the influence of random and non-random ignition locations and normal and extreme weather conditions on fire size distributions and spatial patterns of burn probability. Under extreme weather conditions, fires were significantly larger for non-random ignitions compared to random ignitions (mean area of 344.5 ha and 230.1 ha, respectively), but burn probability maps were highly correlated (r = 0.83). Under normal weather, random ignitions produced significantly larger fires than non-random ignitions (17.5 ha and 13.3 ha, respectively), and the spatial correlations between burn probability maps were not high (r = 0.54), though the difference in the average burn probability was small. The results of the study suggest that the location of ignitions used in fire simulation models may substantially influence the spatial predictions of fire spread patterns. However, the spatial bias introduced by using a random ignition location model may be minimized if the fire simulations are conducted under extreme weather conditions when fire spread is greatest. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70034815</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>O'Shea, Thomas J.</author><author>Cryan, Paul M.</author><author>Snider, E.

We captured 1996 bats of 15 species in mist nets set over water during 120 nights of sampling and recorded echolocation calls of an additional species. The bat fauna at Mesa Verde included every species of bat known west of the Great Plains in Colorado, except the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus). Some species showed skewed sex ratios, primarily due to a preponderance of males. Thirteen species of bats reproduced at Mesa Verde. Major differences in spring precipitation between the 2 years of our study were associated with differences in reproductive rates and, in some species, with numbers of juveniles captured. Reduced reproductive effort during spring drought will have a greater impact on bat populations with the forecasted increase in aridity in much of western North America by models of global climate change. We radiotracked 46 bats of 5 species to roosts and describe the first-known maternity colonies of spotted bats (Euderma maculatum) in Colorado. All 5 species that we tracked to diurnal roosts relied almost exclusively on rock crevices rather than trees or snags, despite the presence of mature forests at Mesa Verde and the use of trees for roosts in similar forests elsewhere by some of these species. Comparisons with past bat surveys at Mesa Verde and in surrounding areas suggest no dramatic evidence for effects of recent stand-replacing fires on the composition of the bat community.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70004003</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pavlovic, Noel B.</author><author>Leicht-Young, Stacey A.</author><author>Grundel, Ralph</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Short-term effects of burn season on flowering phenology of savanna plants</title><secondary-title>Plant Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Plant Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>611-625</pages><volume>212</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire season</keyword><keyword>Indiana Dunes</keyword><keyword>Phenoperiod</keyword><keyword>Resprouter shrubs</keyword><keyword>Savanna forbs and grasses</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1385-0237</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11258-010-9851-5</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We examined the effect of season of burn on flowering phenology of groundlayer species, in the year following burns, in a mesic-sand Midwestern oak savanna. Burn treatments were fall, early-season, growing-season, late-season, and 1 or 5 years after a prior early-season wildfire. For these treatments, we compared the number of flowering stems and of flowers for species overall, for the 20 most prolifically flowering species, as well as for species grouped by flowering phenoperiods, and by growth form. Growing-season burn had a significant negative effect on number of flowering stems and total number of flowers. This effect occurred when either the burn occurred during the flowering season or during the season prior to the flowering phenoperiod. Tradescantia ohiensis showed expedited flowering and Phlox pilosa showed delayed flowering in response to early-season burning. Flowering of early shrubs was reduced by the previous fall and early-spring fires, while flowering of mid-season blooming shrubs was reduced by the early- and growing-season burns. Vaccinium and Gaylussacia , early-flowering shrubs, produced fewer flowers 1 year after than 5 years after an early-season burn. Arabis lyrata showed reduced flowering from the early-season burn. We also found four instances where the early-spring burn effect on flowering was more severe than the fall burn effect, suggesting that many frequent early-season burns may be deleterious to flowering and reproduction of some species. Burns occurring too frequently in the same season could negatively affect future flowering and reproduction of these plant species.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70034702</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Augustine, David J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Habitat selection by mountain plovers in shortgrass steppe</title><secondary-title>Journal of Wildlife Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Wildlife Management</full-title></periodical><pages>297-304</pages><volume>75</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Prescribed fire</keyword><keyword>Grazing</keyword><keyword>Disturbance regimes</keyword><keyword>Grassland</keyword><keyword>Plague</keyword><keyword>Rangeland management</keyword><keyword>Resource selection</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1937-2817</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jwmg.57</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Much of the breeding range for the mountain plover (Charadrius montanus) occurs in shortgrass steppe and mixed-grass prairie in the western Great Plains of North America. Studies of mountain plovers in shortgrass steppe during the 1970s and 1990s were focused in Weld County, Colorado, which was considered a key breeding area for the species. These studies, however, did not include habitats influenced by black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) or prescribed fire. The role of these 2 rangeland disturbance processes has increased substantially over the past 15 years. During 2008–2009, I used radial distance point count surveys to estimate mountain plover densities early in the nesting season in 4 habitats on public lands in Weld County, Colorado. All 4 habitats were grazed by cattle during the growing season at moderate stocking rates but had different additional disturbances consisting of 1) dormant-season prescribed burns, 2) active black-tailed prairie dog colonies, 3) black-tailed prairie dog colonies affected by epizootic plague in the past 1–2 years, and 4) rangeland with no recent history of fire or prairie dogs. Mountain plover densities were similar on active black-tailed prairie dog colonies (${\rm {\bar {X}}}$ = 6.8 birds/km2, 95% CI = 4.3–10.6) and prescribed burns (${\rm {\bar {X}}}$ = 5.6 birds/km2, 95% CI = 3.5–9.1). In contrast, no plovers were detected at randomly selected rangeland sites grazed by cattle but lacking recent disturbance by prairie dogs or fire, even though survey effort was highest for this rangeland habitat. Mountain plover densities were intermediate (2.0 birds/km2, 95% CI = 0.8–5.0) on sites where black-tailed prairie dogs had recently been extirpated by plague. These findings suggest that prescribed burns and active black-tailed prairie dog colonies may enhance breeding habitat for mountain plovers in shortgrass steppe and illustrate the potential for suppressed or altered disturbance processes to influence habitat availability for declining wildlife species. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70074794</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Walters, Sandra P</author><author>Schneider, Norma J</author><author>Guthrie, John D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Geospatial Multi-Agency Coordination (GeoMAC) wildland fire perimeters, 2008</title></titles><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>612</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ds612</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kelly, Susan</author><author>Morgan, Lisa</author><author>McGinnis, Stephanie</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fire and brimstone continues to shape Yellowstone Lake: connecting geology and past climates with today's biodiversity</title><secondary-title>The Earth Scientist</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Earth Scientist</full-title></periodical><pages>23-28</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70044832</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Collins, William B.</author><author>Dale, Bruce W.</author><author>Adams, Layne G.</author><author>McElwain, Darien E.</author><author>Joly, Kyle</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fire, grazing history, lichen abundance, and winter distribution of caribou in Alaska's taiga</title><secondary-title>Journal of Wildlife Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Wildlife Management</full-title></periodical><pages>369-377</pages><volume>75</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire</keyword><keyword>Lichen</keyword><keyword>Alaska</keyword><keyword>Caribou</keyword><keyword>Grazing history</keyword><keyword>Range management</keyword><keyword>Rangifer tarandus</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022541X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jwmg.39</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In the early 1990s the Nelchina Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) Herd (NCH) began a dramatic shift to its current winter range, migrating at least an additional 100 km beyond its historic range. We evaluated the impacts of fire and grazing history on lichen abundance and subsequent use and distribution by the NCH. Historic (prior to 1990) and current (2002) winter ranges of the NCH had similar vascular vegetation, lichen cover (P = 0.491), and fire histories (P = 0.535), but the former range had significantly less forage lichen biomass as a result of grazing by caribou. Biomass of forage lichens was twice as great overall (P = 0.031) and 4 times greater in caribou selected sites on the current range than in the historic range, greatly increasing availability to caribou. Caribou on the current range selected for stands with &gt;20% lichen cover (P &lt; 0.001), greater than 1,250 kg/ha (P &lt; 0.001) forage lichen biomass and stands older than 80 yr postfire (P &lt; 0.001). After fires, forage lichen cover and biomass seldom recovered sufficiently to attract caribou grazing until after &gt;= 60 yr, and, as a group, primary forage lichen species did not reach maximum abundance until 180 yr postfire. Recovery following overgrazing can occur much more quickly because lichen cover, albeit mostly fragments, and organic substrates remain present. Our results provide benchmarks for wildlife managers assessing condition of caribou winter range and predicting effects of fires on lichen abundance and caribou distribution. Of our measurements of cover and biomass by species, densities and heights of trees, elevation, slope and aspect, only percentage cover by Cladonia amaurocraea, Cladina rangiferina, Flavocetraria cuculata, and lowbush cranberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea) were necessary for predicting caribou use of winter range.

Although area burned is often used to summarize a fire season, burned area may not be well correlated with either the number or ecological effect of fires. Using the Landsat data archive, we examined all 148 wildland fires (prescribed fires and wildfires) &gt;40 ha from 1984 through 2009 for the portion of the Sierra Nevada centered on Yosemite National Park, California, USA. We calculated mean fire frequency and mean annual area burned from a combination of field- and satellite-derived data. We used the continuous probability distribution of the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) values to describe fire severity. For fires &gt;40 ha, fire frequency, annual area burned, and cumulative severity were consistent in only 13 of 26 years (50 %), but all pair-wise comparisons among these fire regime attributes were significant. Borrowing from long-established practice in climate science, we defined "fire normals" to be the 26 year means of fire frequency, annual area burned, and the area under the cumulative probability distribution of dNBR. Fire severity normals were significantly lower when they were aggregated by year compared to aggregation by area. Cumulative severity distributions for each year were best modeled with Weibull functions (all 26 years, r2 ≥ 0.99; P &lt; 0.001). Explicit modeling of the cumulative severity distributions may allow more comprehensive modeling of climate-severity and area-severity relationships. Together, the three metrics of number of fires, size of fires, and severity of fires provide land managers with a more comprehensive summary of a given fire year than any single metric.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70036234</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jenkins, Sara E.</author><author>Hull Sieg, Carolyn</author><author>Anderson, Diana E.</author><author>Kaufman, Darrell S.</author><author>Pearthree, Philip A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Late Holocene geomorphic record of fire in ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forests, Kendrick Mountain, northern Arizona, USA</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</full-title></periodical><pages>125-141</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>charcoal</keyword><keyword>crown fire</keyword><keyword>debris flows</keyword><keyword>fire history</keyword><keyword>terrain</keyword><keyword>_Invalid DOI</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1071/WF09093</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Long-term fire history reconstructions enhance our understanding of fire behaviour and associated geomorphic hazards in forested ecosystems. We used 14C ages on charcoal from fire-induced debris-flow deposits to date prehistoric fires on Kendrick Mountain, northern Arizona, USA. Fire-related debris-flow sedimentation dominates Holocene fan deposition in the study area. Radiocarbon ages indicate that stand-replacing fire has been an important phenomenon in late Holocene ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and ponderosa pinemixed conifer forests on steep slopes. Fires have occurred on centennial scales during this period, although temporal hiatuses between recorded fires vary widely and appear to have decreased during the past 2000 years. Steep slopes and complex terrain may be responsible for localised crown fire behaviour through preheating by vertical fuel arrangement and accumulation of excessive fuels. Holocene wildfire-induced debris flow events occurred without a clear relationship to regional climatic shifts (decadal to millennial), suggesting that interannual moisture variability may determine fire year. Fire-debris flow sequences are recorded when (1) sufficient time has passed (centuries) to accumulate fuels; and (2) stored sediment is available to support debris flows. The frequency of reconstructed debris flows should be considered a minimum for severe events in the study area, as fuel production may outpace sediment storage.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70036986</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rostad, Colleen E</author><author>Rutherford, David W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biochar for Soil Fertility and Natural Carbon Sequestration</title></titles><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>FS - 2010-3117</isbn><abstract>Biochar is charcoal (similar to chars generated by forest fires) that is made for incorporation into soils to increase soil fertility while providing natural carbon sequestration.

As part of the effort, many 2000 vintage Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus data sets were used in conjunction with a large volume of field information to generate detailed vegetation type and structure data sets for the entire United States. In order to keep these data sets current and relevant to resource managers, there was strong need to develop an approach for updating these products. We are using three different approaches for these purposes. These include: 1) updating using Landsat-derived historic and current fire burn information derived from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity project; 2) incorporating vegetation disturbance information derived from time series Landsat data analysis using the Vegetation Change Tracker; and 3) developing data products that capture subtle intra-state disturbance such as those related to insects and disease using either Landsat or the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS). While no one single approach provides all of the land cover change and update information required, we believe that a combination of all three captures most of the disturbance conditions taking place that have relevance to the fire community.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5446307/</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Xuexia</author><author>Vogelmann, James E.</author><author>Rollins, Matthew</author><author>Ohlen, Donald</author><author>Key, Carl H.</author><author>Yang, Limin</author><author>Huang, Chengquan</author><author>Shi, Hua</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Detecting post-fire burn severity and vegetation recovery using multitemporal remote sensing spectral indices and field-collected composite burn index data in a ponderosa pine forest</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Remote Sensing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Remote Sensing</full-title></periodical><pages>7905-7927</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>23</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0143-1161</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/01431161.2010.524678</electronic-resource-num><abstract>It is challenging to detect burn severity and vegetation recovery because of the relatively long time period required to capture the ecosystem characteristics. Multitemporal remote sensing data can provide multitemporal observations before, during and after a wildfire, and can improve the change detection accuracy. The goal of this study is to examine the correlations between multitemporal spectral indices and field-observed burn severity, and to provide a practical method to estimate burn severity and vegetation recovery. The study site is the Jasper Fire area in the Black Hills National Forest, South Dakota, that burned during August and September 2000. Six multitemporal Landsat images acquired from 2000 (pre-fire), 2001 (post-fire), 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2007 were used to assess burn severity. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized burn ratio (NBR), integrated forest index (IFI) and the differences of these indices between the pre-fire and post-fire years were computed and analysed with 66 field-based composite burn index (CBI) plots collected in 2002. Results showed that differences of NDVI and differences of EVI between the pre-fire year and the first two years post-fire were highly correlated with the CBI scores. The correlations were low beyond the second year post-fire. Differences of NBR had good correlation with CBI scores in all study years. Differences of IFI had low correlation with CBI in the first year post-fire and had good correlation in later years. A CBI map of the burnt area was produced using regression tree models and the multitemporal images. The dynamics of four spectral indices from 2000 to 2007 indicated that both NBR and IFI are valuable for monitoring long-term vegetation recovery. The high burn severity areas had a much slower recovery than the moderate and low burn areas.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032259</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pan, Yude</author><author>Birdsey, Richard A.</author><author>Fang, Jingyun</author><author>Houghton, Richard</author><author>Kauppi, Pekka E.</author><author>Kurz, Werner A.</author><author>Phillips, Oliver L.</author><author>Shvidenko, Anatoly</author><author>Lewis, Simon L.</author><author>Canadell, Josep G.</author><author>Ciais, Philippe</author><author>Jackson, Robert B.</author><author>Pacala, Stephen W.</author><author>McGuire, A.

We also estimate a source of 1.3 ± 0.7 Pg C year(-1) from tropical land-use change, consisting of a gross tropical deforestation emission of 2.9 ± 0.5 Pg C year(-1) partially compensated by a carbon sink in tropical forest regrowth of 1.6 ± 0.5 Pg C year(-1). Together, the fluxes comprise a net global forest sink of 1.1 ± 0.8 Pg C year(-1), with tropical estimates having the largest uncertainties.

In this study, a type of unsupervised artificial neural network, called a self-organized map (SOM), is trained using data from 540 burned basins in the western United States. The sparsely populated data set includes variables from independent numerical landscape categories (climate, land surface form, geologic texture, and post-fire condition), independent landscape classes (bedrock geology and state), and dependent initiation processes (runoff, landslide, and runoff and landslide combination) and responses (debris flows, floods, and no events). Pattern analysis of the SOM-based component planes is used to identify and interpret relations among the variables. Application of the Davies-Bouldin criteria following k-means clustering of the SOM neurons identified eight conceptual regional models for focusing future research and empirical model development. A split-sample validation on 60 independent basins (not included in the training) indicates that simultaneous predictions of initiation process and response types are at least 78% accurate. As climate shifts from wet to dry conditions, forecasts across the burned landscape reveal a decreasing trend in the total number of debris flow, flood, and runoff events with considerable variability among individual basins. These findings suggest the SOM may be useful in forecasting real-time post-fire hazards, and long-term post-recovery processes and effects of climate change scenarios. © 2011.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032575</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Jinxun</author><author>Vogelmann, James E.</author><author>Zhu, Zhiliang</author><author>Key, Carl H.</author><author>Sleeter, Benjamin M.</author><author>Price, David T.</author><author>Chen, Jing M.</author><author>Cochrane, Mark A.</author><author>Eidenshink, Jeffery C.</author><author>Howard, Stephen M.</author><author>Bliss, Norman B.</author><author>Jiang, Hong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating California ecosystem carbon change using process model and land cover disturbance data: 1951-2000</title><secondary-title>Ecological Modelling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Modelling</full-title></periodical><pages>2333-2341</pages><volume>222</volume><issue>14</issue><keywords><keyword>Climate change</keyword><keyword>Land cover change</keyword><keyword>CO2fertilization</keyword><keyword>Fire disturbance</keyword><keyword>IBIS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0304-3800</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2011.03.042</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Land use change, natural disturbance, and climate change directly alter ecosystem productivity and carbon stock level. The estimation of ecosystem carbon dynamics depends on the quality of land cover change data and the effectiveness of the ecosystem models that represent the vegetation growth processes and disturbance effects. We used the Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS) and a set of 30- to 60-m resolution fire and land cover change data to examine the carbon changes of California's forests, shrublands, and grasslands. Simulation results indicate that during 1951-2000, the net primary productivity (NPP) increased by 7%, from 72.2 to 77.1TgCyr-1(1 teragram=1012g), mainly due to CO2fertilization, since the climate hardly changed during this period. Similarly, heterotrophic respiration increased by 5%, from 69.4 to 73.1TgCyr-1, mainly due to increased forest soil carbon and temperature. Net ecosystem production (NEP) was highly variable in the 50-year period but on average equalled 3.0TgCyr-1(total of 149TgC). As with NEP, the net biome production (NBP) was also highly variable but averaged -0.55TgCyr-1(total of -27.3TgC) because NBP in the 1980s was very low (-5.34TgCyr-1). During the study period, a total of 126Tg carbon were removed by logging and land use change, and 50Tg carbon were directly removed by wildland fires. For carbon pools, the estimated total living upper canopy (tree) biomass decreased from 928 to 834TgC, and the understory (including shrub and grass) biomass increased from 59 to 63TgC. Soil carbon and dead biomass carbon increased from 1136 to 1197TgC. Our analyses suggest that both natural and human processes have significant influence on the carbon change in California. During 1951-2000, climate interannual variability was the key driving force for the large interannual changes of ecosystem carbon source and sink at the state level, while logging and fire were the dominant driving forces for carbon balances in several specific ecoregions. From a long-term perspective, CO2fertilization plays a key role in maintaining higher NPP. However, our study shows that the increase in C sequestration by CO2fertilization is largely offset by logging/land use change and wildland fires. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70036241</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bernhardt, Christopher</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Native Americans, regional drought and tree Island evolution in the Florida Everglades</title><secondary-title>Holocene</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Holocene</full-title></periodical><pages>967-978</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>drought</keyword><keyword>climate variability</keyword><keyword>Everglades</keyword><keyword>late Holocene</keyword><keyword>Native Americans</keyword><keyword>pollen</keyword><keyword>tree island</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0959-6836</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0959683611400204</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This study uses palynologic data to determine the effects of regional climate variability and human activity on the formation and development of tree islands during the last ~4000 years. Although prolonged periods of aridity have been invoked as one mechanism for their formation, Native American land use has also been hypothesized as a driver of tree island development. Using pollen assemblages from head and near tail sediments collected on two tree islands and documented archeological data, the relative roles of Native Americans, climate variability, and recent water-management practices in forming and structuring Everglades tree islands are examined. The timing of changes recorded in the pollen record indicates that tree islands developed from sawgrass marshes ~3800 cal. yr BP, prior to human occupation. Major tree island expansion, recorded near tail sediments, occurred ~1000 years after initial tree island formation. Comparison of the timing of pollen assemblages with other proxy records indicates that tree island expansion is related to regional and global aridity correlated with southward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Local fire associated with droughts may also have influenced tree island expansion. This work suggests that Native American occupation did not significantly influence tree island formation and that the most important factors governing tree island expansion are extreme hydrologic events due to droughts and intense twentieth century water management.

This N deposition has reached a level that has caused or is likely to cause alterations to the structure and function of many ecosystems across the United States. One approach for quantifying the deposition of pollution that would be harmful to ecosystems is the determination of critical loads. A critical load is defined as the input of a pollutant below which no detrimental ecological effects occur over the long-term according to present knowledge. The objectives of this project were to synthesize current research relating atmospheric N deposition to effects on terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems in the United States, and to estimate associated empirical N critical loads. The receptors considered included freshwater diatoms, mycorrhizal fungi, lichens, bryophytes, herbaceous plants, shrubs, and trees. Ecosystem impacts included: (1) biogeochemical responses and (2) individual species, population, and community responses. Biogeochemical responses included increased N mineralization and nitrification (and N availability for plant and microbial uptake), increased gaseous N losses (ammonia volatilization, nitric and nitrous oxide from nitrification and denitrification), and increased N leaching. Individual species, population, and community responses included increased tissue N, physiological and nutrient imbalances, increased growth, altered root : shoot ratios, increased susceptibility to secondary stresses, altered fire regime, shifts in competitive interactions and community composition, changes in species richness and other measures of biodiversity, and increases in invasive species. The range of critical loads for nutrient N reported for U.S. ecoregions, inland surface waters, and freshwater wetlands is 1-39 kg N-ha(-1).yr(-1), spanning the range of N deposition observed over most of the country. The empirical critical loads for N tend to increase in the following sequence for different life forms: diatoms, lichens and bryophytes, mycorrhizal fungi, herbaceous plants and shrubs, and trees. The critical load approach is an ecosystem assessment tool with great potential to simplify complex scientific information and communicate effectively with the policy community and the public. This synthesis represents the first comprehensive assessment of empirical critical loads of N for major ecoregions across the United States.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032699</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hibbs, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vegetation Recovery after Fire in the Klamath-Siskiyou Region , Southern Oregon</title></titles><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2011-3140</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/fs20113140</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nichols, Kevin</author><author>Schoenberg, Frederic Paik</author><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author><author>Bray, Andrew</author><author>Diez, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The application of prototype point processes for the summary and description of California wildfires</title><secondary-title>Journal of Time Series Analysis</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Time Series Analysis</full-title></periodical><pages>420-429</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Marked point processes</keyword><keyword>Point processes</keyword><keyword>Prototypes</keyword><keyword>Spike-time distance</keyword><keyword>Wildfire seasons</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0143-9782</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1467-9892.2011.00734.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A method for summarizing repeated realizations of a space-time marked point process, known as prototyping, is discussed and applied to catalogues of wildfires in California.

The measurements show substantial differences in debris-flow dynamics between sites and between sequential events at the same site. Despite these differences, the timing and magnitude of all events were consistently associated with local peaks in short duration (&lt; = 30 min) rainfall intensity. Overall, debris-flow stage was best cross-correlated with time series of 5-min rainfall intensity, and lagged the rainfall by an average of just 5 min. An index of debris-flow volume was also best correlated with short-duration rainfall intensity, but found to be poorly correlated with storm cumulative rainfall and hillslope soil water content. Post-event observations of erosion and slope stability modeling suggest that the debris flows initiated primarily by processes related to surface water runoff, rather than shallow landslides. By identifying the storm characteristics most closely associated with post-fire debris flows, these measurements provide valuable guidance for warning operations and important constraints for developing and testing models of post-fire debris flows. copyright. 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70036362</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rowland, Mary M</author><author>Leu, Matthias</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Hanser, Steven E</author><author>Leu, Matthias</author><author>Knick, Steven T</author><author>Aldridge, Cameron L</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Study area description: Chapter 1</title><secondary-title>Sagebrush ecosystem conservation and management: Ecoregional assessment tools and models for the Wyoming Basins</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Sagebrush ecosystem conservation and management: Ecoregional assessment tools and models for the Wyoming Basins</full-title></periodical><pages>10-45</pages><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Lawrence, Kansas</pub-location><publisher>Allen Press</publisher><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70175150</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Mantgem, P J</author><author>Stephenson, N L</author><author>Knapp, E</author><author>Battles, J</author><author>Keeley, J E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Long-term effects of prescribed fire on mixed conifer forest structure in the Sierra Nevada, California</title><secondary-title>Forest Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forest Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>989-994</pages><volume>261</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>carbon</keyword><keyword>fire ecology</keyword><keyword>severity</keyword><keyword>bark beetles</keyword><keyword>early-season</keyword><keyword>ecological restoration</keyword><keyword>forest restoration</keyword><keyword>fuel reduction treatment</keyword><keyword>fuel reduction treatments</keyword><keyword>principles</keyword><keyword>spatial pattern</keyword><keyword>tree mortality</keyword><keyword>tree mortality-rates</keyword><keyword>vegetation structure</keyword><keyword>western united-states</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0378-1127</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.foreco.2010.12.013</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The capacity of prescribed fire to restore forest conditions is often judged by changes in forest structure within a few years following burning. However, prescribed fire might have longer-term effects on forest structure, potentially changing treatment assessments. We examined annual changes in forest structure in five 1 ha old-growth plots immediately before prescribed fire and up to eight years after fire at Sequoia National Park, California. Fire-induced declines in stem density (67% average decrease at eight years post-fire) were nonlinear, taking up to eight years to reach a presumed asymptote. Declines in live stem biomass were also nonlinear, but smaller in magnitude (32% average decrease at eight years post-fire) as most large trees survived the fires. The preferential survival of large trees following fire resulted in significant shifts in stem diameter distributions. Mortality rates remained significantly above background rates up to six years after the fires. Prescribed fire did not have a large influence on the representation of dominant species. Fire-caused mortality appeared to be spatially random, and therefore did not generally alter heterogeneous tree spatial patterns. Our results suggest that prescribed fire can bring about substantial changes to forest structure in old-growth mixed conifer forests in the Sierra Nevada, but that long-term observations are needed to fully describe some measures of fire effects.

We used connectivity analyses to: (1) delineate the dominant pattern of sagebrush landscapes; (2) identify regions of the current range-wide distribution of Greater Sage-Grouse important for conservation; (3) estimate distance thresholds that potentially isolate populations; and (4) understand how landscape pattern, environmental disturbance, or location within the spatial network influenced lek persistence during a population decline. Long-term viability of sagebrush, assessed from its dominance in relatively unfragmented landscapes, likely is greatest in south-central Oregon and northwest Nevada; the Owyhee region of southeast Oregon, southwest Idaho, and northern Nevada; southwest Wyoming; and south-central Wyoming. The most important leks (breeding locations) for maintaining connectivity, characterized by higher counts of sage-grouse and connections with other leks, were within the core regions of the sage-grouse range. Sage-grouse populations presently have the highest levels of connectivity in the Wyoming Basin and lowest in the Columbia Basin Sage-Grouse management zones (SMZs). Leks separated by distances &gt;13-18 km could be isolated due to decreased probability of dispersals from neighboring leks. The range-wide distribution of sage-grouse was clustered into 209 separate components (units in which leks were interconnected within but not among) when dispersal was limited to distances &lt;18 km. The most important components for maintaining connectivity were distributed across the central and eastern regions of the range-wide distribution. Connectivity among sage-grouse populations was lost during population declines from 1965-1979 to 1998-2007, most dramatically in the Columbia Basin SMZ. Leks that persisted during this period were larger in size, were more highly connected, and had lower levels of broad-scale fire and human disturbance. Protecting core regions and maintaining connectivity with more isolated sage-grouse populations may help reverse or stabilize the processes of range contraction and isolation that have resulted in long-term population declines.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Matchett, John R</author><author>Brooks, Matthew L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Soil erosion risks following the 2005 Southern Nevada Fire Complex: Chapter 8</title></titles><pages>217-229</pages><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70178816</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Manies, Kristen L</author><author>Harden, Jennifer W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Soil data from different-age Picea mariana stands near Delta Junction, Alaska</title></titles><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2011-1061</isbn><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20111061</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Turetsky, Merritt R.</author><author>Kane, Evan S.</author><author>Harden, Jennifer W.</author><author>Ottmar, Roger D.</author><author>Manies, Kristen L.</author><author>Hoy, Elizabeth</author><author>Kasischke, Eric S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Recent acceleration of biomass burning and carbon losses in Alaskan forests and peatlands</title><secondary-title>Nature Geoscience</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Geoscience</full-title></periodical><pages>27-31</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1752-0894</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/ngeo1027</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Climate change has increased the area affected by forest fires each year in boreal North America1, 2. Increases in burned area and fire frequency are expected to stimulate boreal carbon losses3, 4, 5. However, the impact of wildfires on carbon emissions is also affected by the severity of burning. How climate change influences the severity of biomass burning has proved difficult to assess. Here, we examined the depth of ground-layer combustion in 178 sites dominated by black spruce in Alaska, using data collected from 31 fire events between 1983 and 2005. We show that the depth of burning increased as the fire season progressed when the annual area burned was small. However, deep burning occurred throughout the fire season when the annual area burned was large. Depth of burning increased late in the fire season in upland forests, but not in peatland and permafrost sites. Simulations of wildfire-induced carbon losses from Alaskan black spruce stands over the past 60 years suggest that ground-layer combustion has accelerated regional carbon losses over the past decade, owing to increases in burn area and late-season burning. As a result, soils in these black spruce stands have become a net source of carbon to the atmosphere, with carbon emissions far exceeding decadal uptake</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70033781</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>O'Donnell, Jonathan A.</author><author>Harden, Jennifer W.</author><author>Mcguire, A.

In the boreal region, recent warming has promoted changes in the fire regime, which may exacerbate rates of permafrost thaw and alter soil OC dynamics in both organic and mineral soil. We examined how interactions between fire and permafrost govern rates of soil OC accumulation in organic horizons, mineral soil of the active layer, and near-surface permafrost in a black spruce ecosystem of interior Alaska. To estimate OC accumulation rates, we used chronosequence, radiocarbon, and modeling approaches. We also developed a simple model to track long-term changes in soil OC stocks over past fire cycles and to evaluate the response of OC stocks to future changes in the fire regime. Our chronosequence and radiocarbon data indicate that OC turnover varies with soil depth, with fastest turnover occurring in shallow organic horizons (Gê+60 years) and slowest turnover in near-surface permafrost (&gt;3000 years). Modeling analysis indicates that OC accumulation in organic horizons was strongly governed by carbon losses via combustion and burial of charred remains in deep organic horizons. OC accumulation in mineral soil was influenced by active layer depth, which determined the proportion of mineral OC in a thawed or frozen state and thus, determined loss rates via decomposition. Our model results suggest that future changes in fire regime will result in substantial reductions in OC stocks, largely from the deep organic horizon. Additional OC losses will result from fire-induced thawing of near-surface permafrost. From these findings, we conclude that the vulnerability of deep OC stocks to future warming is closely linked to the sensitivity of permafrost to wildfire disturbance</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70036607</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pereira, Paulo</author><author>beda, Xavier</author><author>Martin, Deborah</author><author>Mataix-Solera, Jorge</author><author>Guerrero, César</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of a low severity prescribed fire on water-soluble elements in ash from a cork oak (Quercus suber) forest located in the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula</title><secondary-title>Environmental Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Research</full-title></periodical><pages>237-247</pages><volume>111</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Prescribed fire</keyword><keyword>Ash</keyword><keyword>Iberian Peninsula</keyword><keyword>Quercus robur</keyword><keyword>Quercus suber</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0013-9351</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.envres.2010.09.002</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Wildfire is the major disturbance in Mediterranean forests. Prescribed fire can be an alternative to reduce the amount of fuel and hence decrease the wildfire risk. However the effects of prescribed fire must be studied, especially on ash properties, because ash is an important nutrient source for ecosystem recovery. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of a low severity prescribed fire on water-soluble elements in ash including pH, electrical conductivity (EC), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), potassium (K), aluminum (Al), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), silica (SiO2) and total sulphur (TS). A prescribed fire was conducted in a cork oak (Quercus suber) (Q.S) forest located in the northeast part of the Iberian Peninsula. Samples were collected from a flat plot of 40×70m mainly composed of Q.S and Quercus robur (Q.R) trees. In order to understand the effects of the prescribed fire on the soluble elements in ash, we conducted our data analysis on three data groups: all samples, only Q.S samples and only Q.R samples. All three sample groups exhibited a significant increase in pH, EC (p&lt;0.001), water-soluble Ca, Mg, Na, SiO2 and TS and a decrease in water-soluble Mn, Fe and Zn. Differences were identified between oak species for water-soluble K, Al and Fe. In Q.S samples we registered a significant increase in the first two elements p&lt;0.001 and p&lt;0.01, respectively, and a non-significant impact in the third, at p&lt;0.05. In Q.R data we identified a non-significant impact on water-soluble K and Al and a significant decrease in water-soluble Fe (p&lt;0.05). These differences are probably due to vegetation characteristics and burn severity. The fire induced a higher variability in the ash soluble elements, especially in Q.S samples, that at some points burned with higher severity. The increase of pH, EC, Ca, Mg, Na and K will improve soil fertility, mainly in the study area where soils are acidic. The application of this low severity prescribed fire will improve soil nutrient status without causing soil degradation and thus is considered to be a good management strategy. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70036933</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pinter, Nicholas</author><author>Fiedel, Stuart</author><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fire and vegetation shifts in the Americas at the vanguard of Paleoindian migration</title><secondary-title>Quaternary Science Reviews</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Quaternary Science Reviews</full-title></periodical><pages>269-272</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>3-4</issue><keywords><keyword>Climate change</keyword><keyword>Fire</keyword><keyword>Vegetation</keyword><keyword>Fire regime</keyword><keyword>Climate</keyword><keyword>Anthropocene</keyword><keyword>Anthropogenic effects</keyword><keyword>Megafauna</keyword><keyword>Vegetation change</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0277-3791</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.quascirev.2010.12.010</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Across North and South America, the final millennia of the Pleistocene saw dramatic changes in climate, vegetation, fauna, fire regime, and other local and regional paleo-environmental characteristics. Rapid climate shifts following the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) exerted a first-order influence, but abrupt post-glacial shifts in vegetation composition, vegetation structure, and fire regime also coincided with human arrival and transformative faunal extinctions in the Americas. We propose a model of post-glacial vegetation change in response to climatic drivers, punctuated by local fire regime shifts in response to megaherbivore-driven fuel changes and anthropogenic ignitions. The abrupt appearance of humans, disappearance of megaherbivores, and resulting changes in New World fire systems were transformative events that should not be dismissed in favor of climate-only interpretations of post-glacial paleo-environmental shifts in the Americas. Fire is a mechanism by which small human populations can have broad impacts, and growing evidence suggests that early anthropogenic influences on regional, even global, paleo-environments should be tested alongside other potential causal mechanisms. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70003980</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Anacker, Brian</author><author>Rajakaruna, Nishanta</author><author>Ackerly, David</author><author>Harrison, Susan</author><author>Keeley, Jon</author><author>Vasey, Michael</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ecological strategies in California chaparral: Interacting effects of soils, climate, and fire on specific leaf area</title><secondary-title>Plant Ecology and Diversity</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Plant Ecology and Diversity</full-title></periodical><pages>179-188</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>2-3</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1755-0874</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/17550874.2011.633573</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: High values of specific leaf area (SLA) are generally associated with high maximal growth rates in resource-rich conditions, such as mesic climates and fertile soils. However, fire may complicate this relationship since its frequency varies with both climate and soil fertility, and fire frequency selects for regeneration strategies (resprouting versus seeding) that are not independent of resource-acquisition strategies. Shared ancestry is also expected to affect the distribution of resource-use and regeneration traits. Aims: We examined climate, soil, and fire as drivers of community-level variation in a key functional trait, SLA, in chaparral in California. Methods: We quantified the phylogenetic, functional, and environmental non-independence of key traits for 87 species in 115 plots. Results: Among species, SLA was higher in resprouters than seeders, although not after phylogeny correction. Among communities, mean SLA was lower in harsh interior climates, but in these climates it was higher on more fertile soils and on more recently burned sites; in mesic coastal climates, mean SLA was uniformly high despite variation in soil fertility and fire history. Conclusions: We conclude that because important correlations exist among both species traits and environmental filters, interpreting the functional and phylogenetic structure of communities may require an understanding of complex interactive effects.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032521</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hasselquist, N.

Our objective was to deter-mine horizontal nutrient fluxes occurring in the saltation zone during an episodic pulse of aeolian transport that occurred following a wildfire in a semi-arid sagebrush steppe ecosys-tem in southern Idaho, USA. We also examined how tempo-ral trends in nutrient fluxes were affected by changes in par-ticle sizes of eroded mass as well as nutrient concentrations associated with different particle size classes. In the burned area, total carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) fluxes were as high as 235 g C m −1 d −1 and 19 g N m −1 d −1 during the first few months following fire, whereas C and N fluxes were negligi-ble in an adjacent unburned area throughout the study. Tem-poral variation in C and N fluxes following fire was largely attributable to the redistribution of saltation-sized particles. Total N and organic C concentrations in the soil surface were significantly lower in the burned relative to the unburned area one year after fire. Our results show how an episodic pulse of aeolian transport following fire can affect the spatial dis-tribution of soil C and N, which, in turn, can have important implications for soil C storage. These findings demonstrate how an ecological disturbance can exacerbate a geomorphic process and highlight the need for further research to bet-ter understand the role aeolian transport plays in the biogeo-chemical cycling of C and N in recently burned landscapes.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032443</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Castro, Jorge</author><author>Allen, Craig D.</author><author>Molina-Morales, Mercedes</author><author>Marañón-Jiménez, Sara</author><author>Sánchez-Miranda, Ángela</author><author>Zamora, Regino</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Salvage Logging Versus the Use of Burnt Wood as a Nurse Object to Promote Post-Fire Tree Seedling Establishment</title><secondary-title>Restoration Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Restoration Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>537-544</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Facilitation</keyword><keyword>Nurse structures</keyword><keyword>Pinus pinaster regeneration</keyword><keyword>Post-fire restoration</keyword><keyword>Salvage harvesting</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1526-100X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1526-100X.2009.00619.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Intense debate surrounds the effects of post-fire salvage logging (SL) versus nonintervention policies on forest regeneration, but scant support is available from experimental studies. We analyze the effect of three post-fire management treatments on the recruitment of a serotinous pine (Pinus pinaster) at a Mediterranean mountain. Treatments were applied 7 months after the fire and differ in the degree of intervention, ranging from “no intervention” (NI, all trees left standing) to “partial cut plus lopping” (PCL, felling most of the trees, cutting the main branches, and leaving all the biomass in situ without mastication), and “SL” (felling and piling the logs, and masticating the woody debris). Seedling survival after 3 years was the highest in PCL (47.3% versus 38.7% in SL). This was associated with the amelioration of microclimatic conditions under the scattered branches, which reduced radiation and soil temperature while increasing soil moisture. Seedling density after 2 years was approximately 5.5 times higher in PCL than in SL, as in SL a large fraction of seedlings was lost as a consequence of mechanized mastication. The NI treatment showed the lowest seedling survival (17.3%). Nevertheless, seedling density was similar to SL. Seedling growth scarcely differed among treatments. Our results show that branches left onsite acted as nurse objects that improved key microclimatic conditions for seedling recruitment. This creates a facilitative interaction ideal for seedling establishment in moisture-deficient ecosystems, as it provides the benefit of a shading overstory but without underground competition.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70036429</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hurteau, Matthew D.</author><author>Brooks, Matthew L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Short- and Long-term Effects of Fire on Carbon in US Dry Temperate Forest Systems</title><secondary-title>BioScience</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BioScience</full-title></periodical><pages>139-146</pages><volume>61</volume><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0006-3568</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1525/bio.2011.61.2.9</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Forests sequester carbon from the atmosphere, and in so doing can mitigate the effects of climate change. Fire is a natural disturbance process in many forest systems that releases carbon back to the atmosphere. In dry temperate forests, fires historically burned with greater frequency and lower severity than they do today. Frequent fires consumed fuels on the forest floor and maintained open stand structures. Fire suppression has resulted in increased understory fuel loads and tree density; a change in structure that has caused a shift from low- to high-severity fires. More severe fires, resulting in greater tree mortality, have caused a decrease in forest carbon stability. Fire management actions can mitigate the risk of high-severity fires, but these actions often require a trade-off between maximizing carbon stocks and carbon stability. We discuss the effects of fire on forest carbon stocks and recommend that managing forests on the basis of their specific ecologies should be the foremost goal, with carbon sequestration being an ancillary benefit.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-lookup/doi/10.1525/bio.2011.61.2.9</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Matsuda, Tritia</author><author>Turschak, Greta</author><author>Brehme, Cheryl</author><author>Rochester, Carlton</author><author>Mitrovich, Milan</author><author>Fisher, Robert</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of Large-Scale Wildfires on Ground Foraging Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in Southern California</title><secondary-title>Environmental Entomology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Entomology</full-title></periodical><pages>204-216</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0046-225X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1603/EN10061</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We investigated the effect of broad-scale wildfire on ground foraging ants within southern California. In October and November of 2003, two wildfires burned large portions of the wildlands within San Diego County. Between January 2005 and September 2006, we surveyed 63 plots across four sites to measure the effect of the fires on the ant assemblages present in four vegetation types: 1) coastal sage scrub, 2) chaparral, 3) grassland, and 4) woodland riparian. Thirty-six of the 63 plots were sampled before the fires between March 2001 and June 2003. Mixed model regression analyses, accounting for the burn history of each plot and our pre- and postfire sampling efforts, revealed that fire had a negative effect on ant species diversity. Multivariate analyses showed that ant community structure varied significantly among the four vegetation types, and only the ant assemblage associated with coastal sage scrub exhibited a significant difference between burned and unburned samples. The most notable change detected at the individual species level involved Messor andrei (Mayr), which increased from &lt;1% of prefire coastal sage scrub ant samples to 32.1% in burned plots postfire. We theorize that M. andrei responded to the increase of bare ground and postfire seed production, leading to an increase in the detection rate for this species. Collectively, our results suggest that wildfires can have short-term impacts on the diversity and community structure of ground foraging ants in coastal sage scrub. We discuss these findings in relation to management implications and directions for future research.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/ee/article-lookup/doi/10.1603/EN10061</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wilson, Jim</author><author>Allen, Craig</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Seeing the forest and the trees: USGS scientist links local changes to global scale</title></titles><pages>1-1</pages><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70118809</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Xuexia</author><author>Liu, Shuguang</author><author>Zhu, Zhiliang</author><author>Vogelmann, James</author><author>Li, Zhengpeng</author><author>Ohlen, Donald</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating aboveground forest biomass carbon and fire consumption in the U.S. Utah High Plateaus using data from the Forest Inventory and Analysis program, Landsat, and LANDFIRE</title><secondary-title>Ecological Indicators</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Indicators</full-title></periodical><pages>140-148</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Burn severity</keyword><keyword>Carbon emissions</keyword><keyword>Regression tree model</keyword><keyword>Spectral vegetation indicator</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1470-160X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ecolind.2009.03.013</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The concentrations of CO2and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have been increasing and greatly affecting global climate and socio-economic systems. Actively growing forests are generally considered to be a major carbon sink, but forest wildfires lead to large releases of biomass carbon into the atmosphere. Aboveground forest biomass carbon (AFBC), an important ecological indicator, and fireinduced carbon emissions at regional scales are highly relevant to forest sustainable management and climate change. It is challenging to accurately estimate the spatial distribution of AFBC across large areas because of the spatial heterogeneity of forest cover types and canopy structure. In this study, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data, Landsat, and Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools Project (LANDFIRE) data were integrated in a regression tree model for estimating AFBC at a 30-m resolution in the Utah High Plateaus. AFBC were calculated from 225 FIA field plots and used as the dependent variable in the model. Of these plots, 10% were held out for model evaluation with stratified random sampling, and the other 90% were used as training data to develop the regression tree model. Independent variable layers included Landsat imagery and the derived spectral indicators, digital elevation model (DEM) data and derivatives, biophysical gradient data, existing vegetation cover type and vegetation structure. The cross-validation correlation coefficient (r value) was 0.81 for the training model. Independent validation using withheld plot data was similar with r value of 0.82. This validated regression tree model was applied to map AFBC in the Utah High Plateaus and then combined with burn severity information to estimate loss of AFBC in the Longston fire of Zion National Park in 2001. The final dataset represented 24 forest cover types for a 4 million ha forested area. We estimated a total of 353 Tg AFBC with an average of 87 MgC/ha in the Utah High Plateaus. We also estimated that 8054 Mg AFBC were released from 2.24 km2burned forest area in the Longston fire. These results demonstrate that an AFBC spatial map and estimated biomass carbon consumption can readily be generated using existing database. The methodology provides a consistent, practical, and inexpensive way for estimating AFBC at 30-m resolution over large areas throughout the United States. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70035456</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schmidt, Kevin M.</author><author>Hanshaw, Maiana N.</author><author>Howle, J.

Fortuitously, we recorded runoff-generat- ed debris-flows triggered by one spatially restricted convective event with 28 mm of rainfall falling over 62 minutes. Our rain gages, nested hillslope over- land-flow sensors and soil-moisture probes, as well as a time series of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) revealed the effects of the storm. Hillslope overland- flow response, along two ~10-m long flow lines per- pendicular to and originating from a drainage divide, displayed only a 10 to 20 minute delay from the on- set of rainfall with accumulated totals of merely 5-10 mm. Depth-stratified soil-moisture probes displayed a greater time delay, roughly 20- 30 minutes, indicating that initial overland flow was Hortonian. Furthermore, a downstream channel-monitoring array recorded a pronounced discharge peak generated by the passage of a debris flow after 18 minutes of rainfall. At this time, only four of the eleven hillslope overlandflow sensors confirmed the presence of surface-water flow. Repeat TLS and detailed field mapping using GPS document how patterns of rainsplash, overland-flow scour, and rilling contributed to the generation of me- ter-scale debris flows. In response to a single small storm, the debris flows deposited irregular levees and lobate terminal snouts on hillslopes and caused wide-spread erosion of the valley axis with ground surface lowering exceeding 1.5 m.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70156814</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app

Biological invasions facilitate ecosystem transformation by altering the structure and function, diversity, dominance and disturbance regimes. A classic case is the grass-fire cycle in which grass invasion increases the frequency, scale and/or intensity of wildfires and promotes the continued invasion of invasive grasses. Despite wide acceptance of the grass-fire cycle, questions linger about the relative roles that interspecific plant competition and fire play in ecosystem transformations. Location: Sonoran Desert Arizona Upland of the Santa Catalina Mountains, Arizona, USA. Methods: We measured species cover, density and saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) size structure along gradients of Vennisetum aliare invasion at 10 unburned/ungrazed P. ciliare patches. Regression models quantified differences in diversity, cover and density with respect to P. ciliare cover, and residence time and a Fisher's exact test detected demographic changes in saguaro populations. Because P. ciliare may have initially invaded locations that were both more invasible and less diverse, we ran analyses with and without the plots in which initial infestations were located. Results: Richness and diversity decreased with P. ciliare cover as did cover and density of most dominant species. Richness and diversity declined with increasing time since invasion, suggesting an ongoing transformation. The proportion of old-to-young Carnegiea gigantea was significantly lower in plots with dominant P. ciliare cover. Main conclusions: Rich desert scrub (15–25 species per plot) was transformed into depauperate grassland (2–5 species per plot) within 20 years following P. ciliare invasion without changes to the fire regime. While the onset of a grassfire cycle may drive ecosystem change in the later stages and larger scales of grass invasions of arid lands, competition by P. ciliare can drive small-scale transformations earlier in the invasion. Linking competition-induced transformation rates with spatially explicit models of spread may be necessary for predicting landscape-level impacts on ecosystem processes in advance of a grass–fire cycle.

It is the inadvertent creation of the disposal of brackish agricultural waste water from the U.S. into the intertidal zone of the river delta in Mexico, but has become an internationally important wetland for resident and migratory water birds. We used high resolution Quickbird and WorldView-2 images to produce seasonal vegetation maps of the Cienega before, during and after a test run of the Yuma Desalting Plant, which will remove water from the inflow stream and replace it with brine. We also used moderate resolution, 16-day composite NDVI imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) sensors on the Terra satellite to determine the main factors controlling green vegetation density over the years 2000-2011. The marsh is dominated by Typha domingensis Pers. with Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. Ex Steud. as a sub-dominant species in shallower marsh areas. The most important factor controlling vegetation density was fire. Spring fires in 2006 and 2011 were followed by much more rapid green-up of T. domingensis in late spring and 30% higher peak summer NDVI values compared to non-fire years (P&lt;. 0.001). Fires removed thatch and returned nutrients to the water, resulting in more vigorous vegetation growth compared to non-fire years. The second significant (P&lt;. 0.01) factor controlling NDVI was flow rate of agricultural drain water from the U.S. into the marsh. Reduced summer flows in 2001 due to canal repairs, and in 2010 during the YDP test run, produced the two lowest NDVI values of the time series from 2000 to 2011 (P&lt;. 0.05). Salinity is a further determinant of vegetation dynamics as determined by greenhouse experiments, but was nearly constant over the period 2000-2011, so it was not a significant variable in regression analyses. It is concluded that any reduction in inflow volumes will result in a linear decrease in green foliage density in the marsh. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70043759</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author><author>Brennan, Teresa J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fire-driven alien invasion in a fire-adapted ecosystem</title><secondary-title>Oecologia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oecologia</full-title></periodical><pages>1043-1052</pages><volume>169</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire regimes</keyword><keyword>Alien plants</keyword><keyword>Crown fires</keyword><keyword>Fire feedbacks</keyword><keyword>Type conversion</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0044201222</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00442-012-2253-8</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Disturbance plays a key role in many alien plant invasions. However, often the main driver of invasion is not disturbance per se but alterations in the disturbance regime. In some fire-adapted shrublands, the community is highly resilient to infrequent, high-intensity fires, but changes in the fire regime that result in shorter fire intervals may make these communities more susceptible to alien plant invasions. This study examines several wildfire events that resulted in short fire intervals in California chaparral shrublands. In one study, we compared postfire recovery patterns in sites with different prefire stand ages (3 and 24 years), and in another study we compared sites that had burned once in four years with sites that had burned twice in this period. The population size of the dominant native shrub Adenostoma fasciculatum was drastically reduced following fire in the 3-year sites relative to the 24-year sites. The 3-year sites had much greater alien plant cover and significantly lower plant diversity than the 24-year sites. In a separate study, repeat fires four years apart on the same sites showed that annual species increased significantly after the second fire, and alien annuals far outnumbered native annuals. Aliens included both annual grasses and annual forbs and were negatively correlated with woody plant cover. Native woody species regenerated well after the first fire but declined after the second fire, and one obligate seeding shrub was extirpated from two sites by the repeat fires. It is concluded that some fire-adapted shrublands are vulnerable to changes in fire regime, and this can lead to a loss of native diversity and put the community on a trajectory towards type conversion from a woody to an herbaceous system. Such changes result in alterations in the proportion of natives to non-natives, changes in functional types from deeply rooted shrubs to shallow rooted grasses and forbs, increased fire frequency due to the increase in fine fuels, and changes in carbon storage.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70124288</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Miller, Mark E.</author><author>Bowker, Matthew A.</author><author>Reynolds, Richard L.</author><author>Goldstein, Harland L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Post-fire land treatments and wind erosion - Lessons from the Milford Flat Fire, UT, USA</title><secondary-title>Aeolian Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Aeolian Research</full-title></periodical><pages>29-44</pages><volume>7</volume><keywords><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Drylands</keyword><keyword>Dust</keyword><keyword>Land treatments</keyword><keyword>Spatial variability</keyword><keyword>Wind erosion</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>18759637</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.aeolia.2012.04.001</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We monitored sediment flux at 25 plots located at the northern end of the 2007 Milford Flat Fire (Lake Bonneville Basin, west-central Utah) to examine the effectiveness of post-fire rehabilitation treatments in mitigating risks of wind erosion during the first 3years post fire. Maximum values were recorded during Mar-Jul 2009 when horizontal sediment fluxes measured with BSNE samplers ranged from 16.3 to 1251.0gm-2d-1in unburned plots (n=8; data represent averages of three sampler heights per plot), 35.2-555.3gm-2d-1in burned plots that were not treated (n=5), and 21.0-44,010.7gm-2d-1in burned plots that received one or more rehabilitation treatments that disturbed the soil surface (n=12). Fluxes during this period exhibited extreme spatial variability and were contingent on upwind landscape characteristics and surficial soil properties, with maximum fluxes recorded in settings downwind of treated areas with long treatment length and unstable fine sand. Nonlinear patterns of wind erosion attributable to soil and fetch effects highlight the profound importance of landscape setting and soil properties as spatial factors to be considered in evaluating risks of alternative post-fire rehabilitation strategies. By Mar-Jul 2010, average flux for all plots declined by 73.6% relative to the comparable 2009 period primarily due to the establishment and growth of exotic annual plants rather than seeded perennial plants. Results suggest that treatments in sensitive erosion-prone settings generally exacerbated rather than mitigated wind erosion during the first 3years post fire, although long-term effects remain uncertain. © 2012.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70044312</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Harden, Jennifer W.</author><author>Manies, Kristen L.</author><author>O'Donnell, Jonathan</author><author>Johnson, Kristofer</author><author>Frolking, Steve</author><author>Fan, Zhaosheng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spatiotemporal analysis of black spruce forest soils and implications for the fate of C</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences</full-title></periodical><volume>117</volume><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>01480227</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011JG001826</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Post-fire storage of carbon (C) in organic-soil horizons was measured in one Canadian and three Alaskan chronosequences in black spruce forests, together spanning stand ages of nearly 200 yrs. We used a simple mass balance model to derive estimates of inputs, losses, and accumulation rates of C on timescales of years to centuries. The model performed well for the surface and total organic soil layers and presented questions for resolving the dynamics of deeper organic soils. C accumulation in all study areas is on the order of 20–40 gC/m2/yr for stand ages up to ∼200 yrs. Much larger fluxes, both positive and negative, are detected using incremental changes in soil C stocks and by other studies using eddy covariance methods for CO2. This difference suggests that over the course of stand replacement, about 80% of all net primary production (NPP) is returned to the atmosphere within a fire cycle, while about 20% of NPP enters the organic soil layers and becomes available for stabilization or loss via decomposition, leaching, or combustion. Shifts toward more frequent and more severe burning and degradation of deep organic horizons would likely result in an acceleration of the carbon cycle, with greater CO2 emissions from these systems overall.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70118269</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Neville, Helen M.</author><author>Gresswell, R.

Time series data stacks were generated for four study areas: (1) a four scene area dominated by forest and rangeland ecosystems in the southwestern United States, (2) a sagebrush-dominated rangeland in Wyoming, (3) woodland adjacent to prairie in northwestern Nebraska, and (4) a forested area in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Through analyses of time series data, we found evidence of gradual systematic change in many of the natural vegetation communities in all four areas. Many of the conifer forests in the southwestern US are showing declines related to insects and drought, but very few are showing evidence of improving conditions or increased greenness. Sagebrush communities are showing decreases in greenness related to fire, mining, and probably drought, but very few of these communities are showing evidence of increased greenness or improving conditions. In Nebraska, forest communities are showing local expansion and increased canopy densification in the prairie-woodland interface, and in the White Mountains high elevation understory conifers are showing range increases towards lower elevations. The trends detected are not obvious through casual inspection of the Landsat images. Analyses of time series data using many scenes and covering multiple years are required in order to develop better impressions and representations of the changing ecosystem patterns and trends that are occurring. The approach described in this paper demonstrates that Landsat time series data can be used operationally for assessing gradual ecosystem change across large areas. Local knowledge and available ancillary data are required in order to fully understand the nature of these trends. © 2012.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70007154</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jain, Theresa B.</author><author>Pilliod, David S.</author><author>Graham, Russell T.</author><author>Lentile, Leigh B.</author><author>Sandquist, Jonathan E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Index for characterizing post-fire soil environments in temperate coniferous forests</title><secondary-title>Forests</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forests</full-title></periodical><pages>445-466</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire Effects</keyword><keyword>Fire Severity</keyword><keyword>Post-Fire Microbes</keyword><keyword>Post-Fire Niche</keyword><keyword>Post-Fire Soil Productivity</keyword><keyword>Soil Burn Severity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1999-4907</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/f3030445</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Many scientists and managers have an interest in describing the environment following a fire to understand the effects on soil productivity, vegetation growth, and wildlife habitat, but little research has focused on the scientific rationale for classifying the post-fire environment. We developed an empirically-grounded soil post-fire index (PFI) based on available science and ecological thresholds. Using over 50 literature sources, we identified a minimum of five broad categories of post-fire outcomes: (a) unburned, (b) abundant surface organic matter (&gt;85% surface organic matter), (c) moderate amount of surface organic matter (≥40 through 85%), (d) small amounts of surface organic matter (&lt;40%), and (e) absence of surface organic matter (no organic matter left). We then subdivided each broad category on the basis of post-fire mineral soil colors providing a more fine-tuned post-fire soil index. We related each PFI category to characteristics such as soil temperature and duration of heating during fire, and physical, chemical, and biological responses. Classifying or describing post-fire soil conditions consistently will improve interpretations of fire effects research and facilitate communication of potential responses or outcomes (e.g., erosion potential) from fires of varying severities.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70039002</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Breshears, David D.</author><author>Kirchner, Thomas B.</author><author>Whicker, Jeffrey J.</author><author>Field, Jason P.</author><author>Allen, Craig D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeling aeolian transport in response to succession, disturbance and future climate: Dynamic long-term risk assessment for contaminant redistribution</title><secondary-title>Aeolian Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Aeolian Research</full-title></periodical><pages>445-457</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Wind erosion</keyword><keyword>Aeolian</keyword><keyword>Contaminant transport</keyword><keyword>Dust emission</keyword><keyword>Risk assessment</keyword><keyword>Sediment production</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1875-9637</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.aeolia.2011.03.012</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Aeolian sediment transport is a fundamental process redistributing sediment, nutrients, and contaminants in dryland ecosystems. Over time frames of centuries or longer, horizontal sediment fluxes and associated rates of contaminant transport are likely to be influenced by succession, disturbances, and changes in climate, yet models of horizontal sediment transport that account for these fundamental factors are lacking, precluding in large part accurate assessment of human health risks associated with persistent soil-bound contaminants. We present a simple model based on empirical measurements of horizontal sediment transport (predominantly saltation) to predict potential contaminant transport rates for recently disturbed sites such as a landfill cover. Omnidirectional transport is estimated within vegetation that changes using a simple Markov model that simulates successional trajectory and considers three types of short-term disturbances (surface fire, crown fire, and drought-induced plant mortality) under current and projected climates. The model results highlight that movement of contaminated soil is sensitive to vegetation dynamics and increases substantially (e.g., &gt; fivefold) when disturbance and/or future climate are considered. The time-dependent responses in horizontal sediment fluxes and associated contaminant fluxes were sensitive to variability in the timing of disturbance, with longer intervals between disturbance allowing woody plants to become dominant and crown fire and drought abruptly reducing woody plant cover. Our results, which have direct implications for contaminant transport and landfill management in the specific context of our assessment, also have general relevance because they highlight the need to more fully account for vegetation dynamics, disturbance, and changing climate in aeolian process studies. © 2011.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032449</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Eidenshink, Jeff C</author><author>Howard, Stephen M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>United States Geological Survey fire science: fire danger monitoring and forecasting</title></titles><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2012-3121</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/fs20123121</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Whitlock, Cathy</author><author>Dean, Walter E.</author><author>Fritz, Sherilyn C.</author><author>Stevens, Lora R.</author><author>Stone, Jeffery R.</author><author>Power, Mitchell J.</author><author>Rosenbaum, Joseph R.</author><author>Pierce, Kenneth L.</author><author>Bracht-Flyr, Brandi B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Holocene seasonal variability inferred from multiple proxy records from Crevice Lake, Yellowstone National Park, USA</title><secondary-title>Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology</full-title></periodical><pages>90-103</pages><volume>331-332</volume><keywords><keyword>Charcoal</keyword><keyword>Holocene</keyword><keyword>Pollen</keyword><keyword>Diatoms</keyword><keyword>Inorganic geochemistry</keyword><keyword>Isotope geochemistry</keyword><keyword>Mineralogy</keyword><keyword>Summer-wet climate</keyword><keyword>Varved sediments</keyword><keyword>Yellowstone National Park</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.palaeo.2012.03.001</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A 9400-yr-old record from Crevice Lake, a semi-closed alkaline lake in northern Yellowstone National Park, was analyzed for pollen, charcoal, geochemistry, mineralogy, diatoms, and stable isotopes to develop a nuanced understanding of Holocene environmental history in a region of northern Rocky Mountains that receives both summer and winter precipitation. The limited surface area, conical bathymetry, and deep water (&gt;31m) of Crevice Lake create oxygen-deficient conditions in the hypolimnion and preserve annually laminated sediment (varves) for much of the record. Pollen data indicate that the watershed supported a closed Pinus-dominated forest and low fire frequency prior to 8200calyr BP, followed by open parkland until 2600calyr BP, and open mixed-conifer forest thereafter. Fire activity shifted from infrequent stand-replacing fires initially to frequent surface fires in the middle Holocene and stand-replacing events in recent centuries. Low values of δ 18O suggest high winter precipitation in the early Holocene, followed by steadily drier conditions after 8500calyr BP. Carbonate-rich sediments before 5000calyr BP imply warmer summer conditions than after 5000calyr BP. High values of molybdenum (Mo), uranium (U), and sulfur (S) indicate anoxic bottom-waters before 8000calyr BP, between 4400 and 3900calyr BP, and after 2400calyr BP. The diatom record indicates extensive water-column mixing in spring and early summer through much of the Holocene, but a period between 2200 and 800calyr BP had strong summer stratification, phosphate limitation, and oxygen-deficient bottom waters. Together, the proxy data suggest wet winters, protracted springs, and warm effectively wet summers in the early Holocene and less snowpack, cool springs, warm dry summers in the middle Holocene. In the late Holocene, the region and lake experienced extreme changes in winter, spring, and summer conditions, with particularly short springs and dry summers and winters during the Roman Warm Period (~2000calyr BP) and Medieval Climate Anomaly (1200-800calyr BP). Long springs and mild summers occurred during the Little Ice Age, and these conditions persist to the present. Although the proxy data indicate effectively wet summer conditions in the early Holocene and drier conditions in the middle and late Holocene, none point specifically to changes in summer precipitation as the cause. Instead, summer conditions were governed by multi-seasonal controls on effective moisture that operated over multiple time scales. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70118333</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rocha, Adrian V.</author><author>Loranty, Michael M.</author><author>Higuera, Phil E.</author><author>MacK, Michelle C.</author><author>Hu, Feng Sheng</author><author>Jones, Benjamin M.</author><author>Breen, Amy L.</author><author>Rastetter, Edward B.</author><author>Goetz, Scott J.</author><author>Shaver, Gus R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The footprint of Alaskan tundra fires during the past half-century: Implications for surface properties and radiative forcing</title><secondary-title>Environmental Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>7</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>climate change</keyword><keyword>fire</keyword><keyword>albedo</keyword><keyword>EVI</keyword><keyword>radiative forcing</keyword><keyword>tundra</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1748-9326</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1088/1748-9326/7/4/044039</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Recent large and frequent fires above the Alaskan arctic circle have forced a reassessment of the ecological and climatological importance of fire in arctic tundra ecosystems. Here we provide a general overview of the occurrence, distribution, and ecological and climate implications of Alaskan tundra fires over the past half-century using spatially explicit climate, fire, vegetation and remote sensing datasets for Alaska. Our analyses highlight the importance of vegetation biomass and environmental conditions in regulating tundra burning, and demonstrate that most tundra ecosystems are susceptible to burn, providing the environmental conditions are right. Over the past two decades, fire perimeters above the arctic circle have increased in size and importance, especially on the North Slope, indicating that future wildfire projections should account for fire regime changes in these regions. Remote sensing data and a literature review of thaw depths indicate that tundra fires have both positive and negative implications for climatic feedbacks including a decadal increase in albedo radiative forcing immediately after a fire, a stimulation of surface greenness and a persistent long-term (&gt;10 year) increase in thaw depth. In order to address the future impact of tundra fires on climate, a better understanding of the control of tundra fire occurrence as well as the long-term impacts on ecosystem carbon cycling will be required.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70045514</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sankey, Joel B.</author><author>Ravi, Sujith</author><author>Wallace, Cynthia S A</author><author>Webb, Robert H.</author><author>Huxman, Travis E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantifying soil surface change in degraded drylands: Shrub encroachment and effects of fire and vegetation removal in a desert grassland</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences</full-title></periodical><volume>117</volume><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2156-2202</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2012JG002002</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Woody plant encroachment, a worldwide phenomenon, is a major driver of land degradation in desert grasslands. Woody plant encroachment by shrub functional types ultimately leads to the formation of a patchy landscape with fertile shrub patches interspaced with nutrient-depleted bare soil patches. This is considered to be an irreversible process of land and soil degradation. Recent studies have indicated that in the early stages of shrub encroachment, when there is sufficient herbaceous connectivity, fires (prescribed or natural) might provide some reversibility to the shrub encroachment process by negatively affecting shrub demography and homogenizing soil resources across patches within weeks to months after burning. A comprehensive understanding of longer term changes in microtopography and spatial patterning of soil properties following fire in shrub-encroached grasslands is desirable. Here, we investigate the changes in microtopography with LiDAR (light detection and ranging), vegetation recovery, and spatial pattering of soil properties in replicated burned, clipped, and control areas in a shrub-grass transition zone in the northern Chihuahuan Desert four years after prescribed fire or clipping. Results indicate a greater homogeneity in soil, microtopography, and vegetation patterning on burned relative to clipped and control treatments. Findings provide further evidence that disturbance by prescribed fire may allow for reversal of the shrub encroachment process, if the event occurs in the early stages of the vegetation shift. Improved understanding of longer-term effects of fire and associated changes in soil patterning can inform the use and role of fire in the context of changing disturbance regimes and climate.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70038768</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Turnbull, L.</author><author>Wilcox, B.

We propose that in drylands, the dynamics of ecosystem state change are determined by changes in the type (stabilizing vs amplifying) and strength of ecohydrological feedbacks following a change in exogenous forces. Using a selection of five case studies from drylands, we explore the characteristics of ecohydrological feedbacks and resulting dynamics of ecosystem state change. We surmise that stabilizing feedbacks are critical for the provision of plantessential resources in drylands. Exogenous forces that break these stabilizing feedbacks can alter the state of the system, although such changes are potentially reversible if strong amplifying ecohydrological feedbacks do not develop. The case studies indicate that if amplifying ecohydrological feedbacks do develop, they are typically associated with abiotic processes such as runoff, erosion (by wind and water), and fire. These amplifying ecohydrological feedbacks progressively modify the system in ways that are long-lasting and possibly irreversible on human timescales.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70042329</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keeley, Jon E</author><author>Bond, William J</author><author>Bradstock, Ross A</author><author>Pausas, Juli G</author><author>Rundel, Philip W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Plant diversity and fire</title><secondary-title>Fire in Mediterranean ecosystems: ecology, evolution and management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Fire in Mediterranean ecosystems: ecology, evolution and management</full-title></periodical><pages>310-329</pages><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Cambridge, UK</pub-location><publisher>Cambridge University Press</publisher><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70157425</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jones, John W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Wetland fire remote sensing research--The Greater Everglades example</title></titles><pages>2-2</pages><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2012-3133</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/fs20123133</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Minsley, Burke J.</author><author>Abraham, Jared D.</author><author>Smith, Bruce D.</author><author>Cannia, James C.</author><author>Voss, Clifford I.</author><author>Jorgenson, M.

Permafrost thawing has been linked to changes in wetland and lake areas, alteration of the groundwater contribution to streamflow, carbon release, and increased fire frequency. But detailed knowledge about the dynamic state of permafrost in relation to surface and groundwater systems remains an enigma. Here, we present the results of a pioneering ∼1,800 line-kilometer airborne electromagnetic survey that shows sediments deposited over the past ∼4 million years and the configuration of permafrost to depths of ∼100 meters in the Yukon Flats area near Fort Yukon, Alaska. The Yukon Flats is near the boundary between continuous permafrost to the north and discontinuous permafrost to the south, making it an important location for examining permafrost dynamics. Our results not only provide a detailed snapshot of the present-day configuration of permafrost, but they also expose previously unseen details about potential surface – groundwater connections and the thermal legacy of surface water features that has been recorded in the permafrost over the past ∼1,000 years. This work will be a critical baseline for future permafrost studies aimed at exploring the connections between hydrogeologic, climatic, and ecological processes, and has significant implications for the stewardship of Arctic environments.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032696</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mccleskey, By R Blaine</author><author>Writer, Jeffrey H</author><author>Murphy, Sheila F</author><author>Survey, U S Geological</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Water Chemistry of Surface Waters Affected by the Fourmile Canyon Wildfire, Colorado, 2010 – 2011</title></titles><pages>2010-2011</pages><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2012-1104</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20121104</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keeley, Jon E</author><author>Bond, William J</author><author>Bradstock, Ross A</author><author>Pausas, Juli G</author><author>Rundel, Philip W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Alien Species and Fire</title><secondary-title>Fire in Mediterranean Ecosystems: Ecology, Evolution and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Fire in Mediterranean Ecosystems: Ecology, Evolution and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>330-348</pages><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Cambridge, UK</pub-location><publisher>Cambridge University Press</publisher><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70007269</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ecology and evolution of pine life histories</title><secondary-title>Annals of Forest Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of Forest Science</full-title></periodical><pages>445-453</pages><volume>69</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Disturbance</keyword><keyword>Abiotic stress</keyword><keyword>Cenozoic</keyword><keyword>Crown fire</keyword><keyword>Life history</keyword><keyword>Mesozoic</keyword><keyword>Surface fire</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1286-4560</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s13595-012-0201-8</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Pinus is a diverse genus of trees widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Understanding pine life history is critical to both conservation and fire management. Here I lay out the different pathways of pine life history adaptation and a brief overview of pine evolution and the very significant role that fire has played. Pinus originated 150 Ma in the mid-Mesozoic Era and radiated across the northern continent of Laurasia during the Cretaceous Period. Pines have followed two evolutionary strategies interpreted as responses to competition by the newly emerging angiosperms. The Strobus lineage mostly has radiated into stressful sites of low nutrient soils and extremes in cold or heat. The Pinus (subgenus) lineage has radiated into fire-prone landscapes with diverse fire regimes. Examination of life history traits illustrates syndromes associated with fire-avoider, fire-tolerater, fire-embracer, and fire-refuge strategies. Understanding the current pattern of pine distribution requires interpreting their evolution in terms of climate, geology, and fire. All three of these factors have played a role since the Mesozoic origin of the genus. All are important to the appropriate management of these resources.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70042768</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Macy, Jamie P</author><author>Amoroso, Lee</author><author>Kennedy, Jeffrey R.</author><author>Unema, Joel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Depth of Cinder Deposits and Water-Storage Capacity at Cinder Lake , Coconino County , Arizona</title></titles><pages>26-26</pages><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2012-1018</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20121018</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brooks, Matthew L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of high fire frequency in creosote bush scrub vegetation of the Mojave Desert</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</full-title></periodical><pages>61-68</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>disturbance</keyword><keyword>fire effects</keyword><keyword>annual grass</keyword><keyword>Bromus rubens</keyword><keyword>ecosystem transformer</keyword><keyword>grass-fire cycle</keyword><keyword>red brome</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1049-8001</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1071/WF10140</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Plant invasions can increase fire frequency in desert ecosystems where fires were historically infrequent. Although there are many resource management concerns associated with high frequency fire in deserts, fundamental effects on plant community characteristics remain largely unstudied. Here I describe the effects of fire frequency on creosote bush scrub vegetation in the Mojave Desert, USA. Biomass of the invasive annual grass Bromus rubens L. increased following fire, but did not increase further with additional fires. In contrast, density, cover and species richness of native perennial plants each decreased following fire and continued to decrease with subsequent fires, although not as dramatically as after the initial fire. Responses were similar 5 and 14 years post-fire, except that cover of Hymenoclea salsola Torr.&amp; A. Gray and Achnatherum speciosa Trin. &amp; Rupr. both increased in areas burnt once. These results suggest that control of B. rubens may be equally warranted after one, two or three fires, but revegetation of native perennial plants is most warranted following multiple fires. These results are valid within the scope of this study, which is defined as relatively short term vegetation responses (&lt;= 14 years) to short fire return intervals (6.3 and 7.3 years for the two and three fire frequency levels) within creosote bush scrub of the Mojave Desert.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032608</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lemckert, Francis</author><author>Hecnar, Stephen</author><author>Pilliod, David S</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Wilkinson, John W</author><author>Heatwole, Harold</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Loss and modification of habitat</title><secondary-title>Conservation and decline of amphibians: ecological aspects, effect of humans, and management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Conservation and decline of amphibians: ecological aspects, effect of humans, and management</full-title></periodical><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Surrey Beatty</publisher><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70156827</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hayes, Daniel J.</author><author>Turner, David P.</author><author>Stinson, Graham</author><author>McGuire, A.

The approach notably retains information on the spatial distribution of NEE, or the vertical exchange between land and atmosphere of all non-fossil fuel sources and sinks of CO2, while accounting for lateral transfers of forest and crop products as well as their eventual emissions. The total NEE estimate of a -327 similar to +/-similar to 252 similar to TgC similar to yr-1 sink for NA was driven primarily by CO2 uptake in the Forest Lands sector (-248 similar to TgC similar to yr-1), largely in the Northwest and Southeast regions of the US, and in the Crop Lands sector (-297 similar to TgC similar to yr-1), predominantly in the Midwest US states. These sinks are counteracted by the carbon source estimated for the Other Lands sector (+218 similar to TgC similar to yr-1), where much of the forest and crop products are assumed to be returned to the atmosphere (through livestock and human consumption). The ecosystems of Mexico are estimated to be a small net source (+18 similar to TgC similar to yr-1) due to land use change between 1993 and 2002. We compare these inventory-based estimates with results from a suite of terrestrial biosphere and atmospheric inversion models, where the mean continental-scale NEE estimate for each ensemble is -511 similar to TgC similar to yr-1 and -931 similar to TgC similar to yr-1, respectively. In the modeling approaches, all sectors, including Other Lands, were generally estimated to be a carbon sink, driven in part by assumed CO2 fertilization and/or lack of consideration of carbon sources from disturbances and product emissions. Additional fluxes not measured by the inventories, although highly uncertain, could add an additional -239 similar to TgC similar to yr-1 to the inventory-based NA sink estimate, thus suggesting some convergence with the modeling approaches.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70038319</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Verdin, Kristine L.</author><author>Dupree, Jean A.</author><author>Elliot, John G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Probability and Volume of Potential Postwildfire Debris Flows in the 2012 High Park Burn Area near Fort Collins , Colorado</title></titles><pages>9-9</pages><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2012-1148</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20121148</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bradford, John B.</author><author>Fraver, Shawn</author><author>Milo, Amy M.</author><author>D'Amato, Anthony W.</author><author>Palik, Brian</author><author>Shinneman, Douglas J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of multiple interacting disturbances and salvage logging on forest carbon stocks</title><secondary-title>Forest Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forest Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>209-214</pages><volume>267</volume><issue>2012</issue><keywords><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Forest management</keyword><keyword>Blowdown</keyword><keyword>Jack pine</keyword><keyword>Windthrow</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0378-1127</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.foreco.2011.12.010</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Climate change is anticipated to increase the frequency of disturbances, potentially impacting carbon stocks in terrestrial ecosystems. However, little is known about the implications of either multiple disturbances or post-disturbance forest management activities on ecosystem carbon stocks. This study quantified how forest carbon stocks responded to stand-replacing blowdown and wildfire, both individually and in combination with and without post-disturbance salvage operations, in a sub-boreal jack pine ecosystem. Individually, blowdown or fire caused similar decreases in live carbon and total ecosystem carbon. However, whereas blowdown increased carbon in down woody material and forest floor, fire increased carbon in standing snags, a difference that may have consequences for long-term carbon cycling patterns. Fire after the blowdown caused substantial additional reduction in ecosystem carbon stocks, suggesting that potential increases in multiple disturbance events may represent a challenge for sustaining ecosystem carbon stocks. Salvage logging, as examined here, decreased carbon stored in snags and down woody material but had no significant effect on total ecosystem carbon stocks. © 2011.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032342</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hoover, Amber N.</author><author>Germino, Matthew J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A common-garden study of resource-Island effects on a native and an exotic, annual grass after fire</title><secondary-title>Rangeland Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Rangeland Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>160-170</pages><volume>65</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>cheatgrass</keyword><keyword>bluebunch wheatgrass</keyword><keyword>coppice</keyword><keyword>heterogeneity</keyword><keyword>interspace</keyword><keyword>sagebrush</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1550-7424</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2111/REM-D-11-00026.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Plant-soil variation related to perennial-plant resource islands (coppices) interspersed with relatively bare interspaces is a major source of heterogeneity in desert rangelands. Our objective was to determine how native and exotic grasses vary on coppice mounds and interspaces (microsites) in unburned and burned sites and underlying factors that contribute to the variation in sagebrush-steppe rangelands of the Idaho National Lab, where interspaces typically have abiotic crusts. We asked how the exotic cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) and native bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata [Pursh] A. Lve) were distributed among the microsites and measured their abundances in three replicate wildfires and nearby unburned areas. We conducted a common-garden study in which soil cores from each burned microsite type were planted with seed of either species to determine microsite effects on establishment and growth of native and exotic grasses. We assessed soil physical properties in the common-garden study to determine the intrinsic properties of each microsite surface and the retention of microsite soil differences following transfer of soils to the garden, to plant growth, and to wetting/drying cycles. In the field study, only bluebunch wheatgrass density was greater on coppice mounds than interspaces, in both unburned and burned areas. In the common-garden experiment, there were microsite differences in soil physical properties, particularly in crust hardness and its relationship to moisture, but soil properties were unaffected by plant growth. Also in the experiment, both species had equal densities yet greater dry mass production on coppice-mound soils compared to interspace soils, suggesting microsite differences in growth but not establishment (likely related to crust weakening resulting from watering). Coppice-interspace patterning and specifically native-herb recovery on coppices is likely important for postfire resistance of this rangeland to cheatgrass. © 2012 Society for Range Management.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70038518</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Coupe, Richard H.</author><author>Barlow, Jeannie R B</author><author>Capel, Paul D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Complexity of human and ecosystem interactions in an agricultural landscape</title><secondary-title>Environmental Development</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Development</full-title></periodical><pages>88-104</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Biofuels</keyword><keyword>Glyphosate</keyword><keyword>Irrigation</keyword><keyword>Mississippi</keyword><keyword>Water quality</keyword><keyword>Water quantity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2211-4645</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.envdev.2012.09.009</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The complexity of human interaction in the commercial agricultural landscape and the resulting impacts on the ecosystem services of water quality and quantity are largely ignored by the current agricultural paradigm that maximizes crop production over other ecosystem services. Three examples at different spatial scales (local, regional, and global) are presented where human and ecosystem interactions in a commercial agricultural landscape adversely affect water quality and quantity in unintended ways in the Delta of northwestern Mississippi. In the first example, little to no regulation of groundwater use for irrigation has caused declines in groundwater levels resulting in loss of baseflow to streams and threatening future water supply. In the second example, federal policy that subsidizes corn for biofuel production has encouraged many producers to switch from cotton to corn, which requires more nutrients and water, counter to national efforts to reduce nutrient loads to the Gulf of Mexico and exacerbating groundwater-level declines. The third example is the wholesale adoption of a system for weed control that relies on a single chemical, initially providing many benefits but ultimately leading to the widespread occurrence of glyphosate and its degradates in Delta streams and necessitating higher application rates of glyphosate as well as the use of other herbicides due to increasing weed resistance. Although these examples are specific to the Mississippi Delta, analogous situations exist throughout the world and point to the need for change in how we grow our food, fuel, and fiber, and manage our soil and water resources. ?? 2012.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70155849</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ebel, B.

Little is known about the immediate effects of wildfire on snowmelt and near-surface hydrologic responses, including soil-water storage. Montane systems at the rain-snow transition have soil-water dynamics that are further complicated during the snowmelt period by strong aspect controls on snowmelt and soil thawing. Here we present data from field measurements of snow hydrology and subsurface hydrologic and temperature responses during the first winter and spring after the September 2010 Fourmile Canyon Fire in Colorado, USA. Our observations of soil-water content and soil temperature show sharp contrasts in hydrologic and thermal conditions between north- and south-facing slopes. South-facing burned soils were ∼1–2 °C warmer on average than north-facing burned soils and ∼1.5 °C warmer than south-facing unburned soils, which affected soil thawing during the snowmelt period. Soil-water dynamics also differed by aspect: in response to soil thawing, soil-water content increased approximately one month earlier on south-facing burned slopes than on north-facing burned slopes. While aspect and wildfire affect soil-water dynamics during snowmelt, soil-water storage at the end of the snowmelt period reached the value at field capacity for each plot, suggesting that post-snowmelt unsaturated storage was not substantially influenced by aspect in wildfire-affected areas. Our data and analysis indicate that the amount of snowmelt-driven groundwater recharge may be larger in wildfire-impacted areas, especially on south-facing slopes, because of earlier soil thaw and longer durations of soil-water contents above field capacity in those areas.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70182150</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Markon, Carl J</author><author>Trainor, Sarah F</author><author>Chapin, F Stuart</author><author>Markon, Carl J</author><author>Trainor, Sarah F</author><author>Chapin III, F Stuart</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The United States National Climate Assessment - Alaska Technical Regional Report</title></titles><pages>148-148</pages><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>1379</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/cir1379</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moody, John A.</author><author>Ebel, Brian A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hyper-dry conditions provide new insights into the cause of extreme floods after wildfire</title><secondary-title>Catena</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Catena</full-title></periodical><pages>58-63</pages><volume>93</volume><keywords><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Hyper-dry</keyword><keyword>Retention curve</keyword><keyword>Soil moisture</keyword><keyword>Unsaturated</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0341-8162</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.catena.2012.01.006</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A catastrophic wildfire in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains near Boulder, Colorado provided a unique opportunity to investigate soil conditions immediately after a wildfire and before alteration by rainfall. Measurements of near-surface (&lt;6cm) soil properties (temperature, volumetric soil-water content, ??; and matric suction, ??), rainfall, and wind velocity were started 8days after the wildfire began. These measurements established that hyper-dry conditions (??&lt;~0.02cm &#xD;3cm&#xD;-3; ??&gt;~3??10&#xD;5cm) existed and provided an in-situ retention curve for these conditions. These conditions exacerbate the effects of water repellency (natural and fire-induced) and limit the effectiveness of capillarity and gravity driven infiltration into fire-affected soils. The important consequence is that given hyper-dry conditions, the critical rewetting process before the first rain is restricted to the diffusion-adsorption of water-vapor. This process typically has a time scale of days to weeks (especially when the hydrologic effects of the ash layer are included) that is longer than the typical time scale (minutes to hours) of some rainstorms, such that under hyper-dry conditions essentially no rain infiltrates. The existence of hyper-dry conditions provides insight into why, frequently during the first rain storm after a wildfire, nearly all rainfall becomes runoff causing extreme floods and debris flows. ?? 2012.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70038903</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author><author>Fotheringham, C.

Vegetation sampling was conducted in tenth hectare plots with nested subplots for the first two years after fire. Floras in the two regions were compared with Jaccard’s Index and importance of families and genera compared with dominance-diversity curves. Although there were 44 families in common between the two regions, the dominant families differed; Poaceae and Fabaceae in Arizona and Hydrophyllaceae and Rosaceae in California. Dominance diversity curves indicated in the first year a more equable distribution of families in Arizona than in California. Woody plants were much more dominant in the mediterranean climate and herbaceous plants more dominant in the bimodal rainfall climate. Species diversity was comparable in both regions at the lowest spatial scales but not at the tenth hectare scale. Due to the double growing season in the non-mediterranean region, the diversity for the first year comprised two different herbaceous floras in the fall and spring growing seasons. The Mediterranean climate in California, in contrast, had only a spring growing season and thus the total diversity for the first year was significantly greater in Arizona than in California for both annuals and herbaceous perennials. Chaparral in these two climate regimes share many dominant shrub species but the postfire communities are very different. Arizona chaparral has both a spring and fall growing season and these produce two very different postfire floras. When combined, the total annual diversity was substantially greater in Arizona chaparral</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.3120/0024-9637-59.3.109</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lloyd, John D.</author><author>Slater, Gary L.</author><author>Snyder, James R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The role of fire-return interval and season of burn in snag dynamics in a South Florida slash pine forest</title><secondary-title>Fire Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Fire Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>18-31</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire effects</keyword><keyword>USA</keyword><keyword>Cavity-nesting birds</keyword><keyword>Florida</keyword><keyword>Pinus elliottii var densa</keyword><keyword>Snags</keyword><keyword>South Florida slash pine</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1933-9747</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.4996/fireecology.0803018</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Standing dead trees, or snags, are an important habitat element for many animal species. In many ecosystems, fire is a primary driver of snag population dynamics because it can both create and consume snags. The objective of this study was to examine how variation in two key components of the fire regime-fire-return interval and season of burn-affected population dynamics of snags. Using a factorial design, we exposed 1 ha plots, located within larger burn units in a south Florida slash pine (Pinus elliottii var. densa Little and Dorman) forest, to prescribed fire applied at two intervals (approximately 3-year intervals vs. approximately 6-year intervals) and during two seasons (wet season vs. dry season) over a 12- to 13-year period. We found no consistent effect of fire season or frequency on the density of lightly to moderately decayed or heavily decayed snags, suggesting that variation in these elements of the fire regime at the scale we considered is relatively unimportant in the dynamics of snag populations. However, our confidence in these findings is limited by small sample sizes, potentially confounding effects of unmeasured variation in fire behavior and effects (e.g., intensity, severity, synergy with drought cycles) and wide variation in responses within a treatment level. The generalizing of our findings is also limited by the narrow range of treatment levels considered. Future experiments incorporating a wider range of fire regimes and directly quantifying fire intensity would prove useful in identifying more clearly the role of fire in shaping the dynamics of snag populations.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70045033</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stephens, Scott L.</author><author>Boerner, Ralph E.

A recent U.S. executive order mandated that all federal agencies account for sequestration and emissions of greenhouse gases, highlighting the importance of understanding how forest carbon stocks are influenced by wildfire. This paper reports the effects of the most common forest fuel reduction treatments on carbon pools composed of live and dead biomass as well as potential wildfire emissions from six different sites in four western U.S. states. Additionally, we predict the median forest product life spans and uses of materials removed during mechanical treatments. Carbon loss from modeled wildfire-induced tree mortality was lowest in the mechanical plus prescribed fire treatments, followed by the prescribed fire-only treatments. Wildfire emissions varied from 10-80 Mg/ha and were lowest in the prescribed fire and mechanical followed by prescribed fire treatments at most sites. Mean biomass removals per site ranged from approximately 30-60 dry Mg/ha; the median lives of products in first use varied considerably (from 50 years). Our research suggests most of the benefits of increased fire resistance can be achieved with relatively small reductions in current carbon stocks. Retaining or growing larger trees also reduced the vulnerability of carbon loss from wildfire. In addition, modeled vulnerabilities to carbon losses and median forest product life spans varied considerably across our study sites, which could be used to help prioritize treatment implementation.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://doi.wiley.com/10.1890/ES11-00289.1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Howard, Rebecca J</author><author>Allain, Larry</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of a drawdown on plant communities in a freshwater impoundment at Lacassine National Wildlife Refuge, Louisiana</title></titles><pages>37-37</pages><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2012-5221</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20125221</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moody, John A.</author><author>Ebel, Brian A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Difference infiltrometer: A method to measure temporally variable infiltration rates during rainstorms</title><secondary-title>Hydrological Processes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hydrological Processes</full-title></periodical><pages>3312-3318</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>21</issue><keywords><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Infiltration</keyword><keyword>Runoff</keyword><keyword>Convective and cyclonic storms</keyword><keyword>Fourmile Canyon</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1099-1085</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/hyp.9424</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We developed a difference infiltrometer to measure time series of\nnon-steady infiltration rates during rainstorms at the point scale.\nThe infiltrometer uses two, tipping bucket rain gages.

It\ncan be used to assess infiltration models, determine runoff coefficients,\nidentify rainfall depth or rainfall intensity thresholds to initiate\nrunoff, estimate parameters for infiltration models, and compare\nremediation treatments on disturbed landscapes. The difference infiltrometer\ncan be linked with other types of soil monitoring equipment in long-term\nstudies for detecting temporal and spatial variability at multiple\ntime scales and in nested designs where it can be linked to hillslope\nand basin-scale runoff responses.

An accurate estimation of biomass at a regional scale provides an important data input for ecological modeling in this region. In this study, we created an aboveground biomass (AGB) map at 30-m resolution for the Yukon Flats ecoregion of interior Alaska using Landsat data and field measurements. Tree, shrub, and herbaceous AGB data in both live and dead forms were collected in summers and autumns of 2009 and 2010. Using the Landsat-derived spectral variables and the field AGB data, we generated a regression model and applied this model to map AGB for the ecoregion. A 3-fold cross-validation indicated that the AGB estimates had a mean absolute error of 21.8 Mg/ha and a mean bias error of 5.2 Mg/ha. Additionally, we validated the mapping results using an airborne lidar dataset acquired for a portion of the ecoregion. We found a significant relationship between the lidar-derived canopy height and the Landsat-derived AGB (R2 = 0.40). The AGB map showed that 90% of the ecoregion had AGB values ranging from 10 Mg/ha to 134 Mg/ha. Vegetation types and fires were the primary factors controlling the spatial AGB patterns in this ecoregion.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70043291</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Germino, Matthew J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Selecting sagebrush seed sources for restoration in a variable climate: ecophysiological variation among genotypes</title></titles><pages>24-29</pages><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Boise, ID</pub-location><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70046998</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barrett, Kirsten</author><author>Rocha, Adrianv</author><author>Van De Weg, Martine Janet</author><author>Shaver, Gaius</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vegetation shifts observed in arctic tundra 17 years after fire</title><secondary-title>Remote Sensing Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Remote Sensing Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>729-736</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>8</issue><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2150-704X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/2150704X.2012.676741</electronic-resource-num><abstract>With anticipated climate change, tundra fires are expected to occur more frequently in the future, but data on the long-term effects of fire on tundra vegetation composition are scarce. This study addresses changes in vegetation structure that have persisted for 17 years after a tundra fire on the North Slope of Alaska. Fire-related shifts in vegetation composition were assessed from remote-sensing imagery and ground observations of the burn scar and an adjacent control site. Early-season remotely sensed imagery from the burn scar exhibits a low vegetation index compared with the control site, whereas the late-season signal is slightly higher. The range and maximum vegetation index are greater in the burn scar, although the mean annual values do not differ among the sites. Ground observations revealed a greater abundance of moss in the unburned site, which may account for the high early growing season normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) anomaly relative to the burn. The abundance of graminoid species and an absence of Betula nana in the post-fire tundra sites may also be responsible for the spectral differences observed in the remotely sensed imagery. The partial replacement of tundra by graminoid-dominated ecosystems has been predicted by the ALFRESCO model of disturbance, climate and vegetation succession.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70041036</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Johnson, Joshua B.</author><author>Mark Ford, W.</author><author>Edwards, John W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Roost networks of northern myotis (Myotis septentrionalis) in a managed landscape</title><secondary-title>Forest Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forest Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>223-231</pages><volume>266</volume><keywords><keyword>Fission-fusion</keyword><keyword>Graph theory</keyword><keyword>Myotis septentrionalis</keyword><keyword>Roosting</keyword><keyword>Social groups</keyword><keyword>West Virginia</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0378-1127</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.foreco.2011.11.032</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Maternity groups of many bat species conform to fission-fusion models and movements among diurnal roost trees and individual bats belonging to these groups use networks of roost trees. Forest disturbances may alter roost networks and characteristics of roost trees. Therefore, at the Fernow Experimental Forest in West Virginia, we examined roost tree networks of northern myotis (Myotis septentrionalis) in forest stands subjected to prescribed fire and in unmanipulated control treatments in 2008 and 2009. Northern myotis formed social groups whose roost areas and roost tree networks overlapped to some extent. Roost tree networks largely resembled scale-free network models, as 61% had a single central node roost tree. In control treatments, central node roost trees were in early stages of decay and surrounded by greater basal area than other trees within the networks. In prescribed fire treatments, central node roost trees were small in diameter, low in the forest canopy, and surrounded by low basal area compared to other trees in networks. Our results indicate that forest disturbances, including prescribed fire, can affect availability and distribution of roosts within roost tree networks. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032722</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sturtevant, Brian R.</author><author>Miranda, Brian R.</author><author>Shinneman, Douglas J.</author><author>Gustafson, Eric J.</author><author>Wolter, Peter T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparing modern and presettlement forest dynamics of a subboreal wilderness: Does spruce budworm enhance fire risk?</title><secondary-title>Ecological Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>1278-1296</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Minnesota</keyword><keyword>Disturbance ecology</keyword><keyword>Succession</keyword><keyword>Abies balsamea</keyword><keyword>Insect-fire interactions</keyword><keyword>LANDIS-II</keyword><keyword>Laurentian mixed forest</keyword><keyword>Spruce budworm</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1051-0761</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1890/11-0590.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Insect disturbance is often thought to increase fire risk through enhanced fuel loadings, particularly in coniferous forest ecosystems. Yet insect disturbances also affect successional pathways and landscape structure that interact with fire disturbances (and vice-versa) over longer time scales. We applied a landscape succession and disturbance model (LANDIS-II) to evaluate the relative strength of interactions between spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) outbreaks and fire disturbances in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area (BWCA) in northern Minnesota (USA). Disturbance interactions were evaluated for two different scenarios: presettlement forests and fire regimes vs. contemporary forests and fire regimes. Forest composition under the contemporary scenario trended toward mixtures of deciduous species (primarily Betula papyrifera and Populus spp.) and shade-tolerant conifers (Picea mariana, Abies balsamea, Thuja occidentalis), with disturbances dominated by a combination of budworm defoliation and high-severity fires. The presettlement scenario retained comparatively more "big pines" (i.e., Pinus strobus, P. resinosa) and tamarack (L. laricina), and experienced less budworm disturbance and a comparatively less-severe fire regime. Spruce budworm disturbance decreased area burned and fire severity under both scenarios when averaged across the entire 300-year simulations. Contrary to past research, area burned and fire severity during outbreak decades were each similar to that observed in non-outbreak decades. Our analyses suggest budworm disturbances within forests of the BWCA have a comparatively weak effect on long-term forest composition due to a combination of characteristics. These include strict host specificity, fine-scaled patchiness created by defoliation damage, and advance regeneration of its primary host, balsam fir (A. balsamea) that allows its host to persist despite repeated disturbances. Understanding the nature of the three-way interaction between budworm, fire, and composition has important ramifications for both fire mitigation strategies and ecosystem restoration initiatives. We conclude that budworm disturbance can partially mitigate long-term future fire risk by periodically reducing live ladder fuel within the mixed forest types of the BWCA but will do little to reverse the compositional trends caused in part by reduced fire rotations.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70041655</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Arkle, Robert S.</author><author>Pilliod, David S.</author><author>Welty, Justin L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pattern and process of prescribed fires influence effectiveness at reducing wildfire severity in dry coniferous forests</title><secondary-title>Forest Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forest Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>174-184</pages><volume>276</volume><keywords><keyword>Burn severity</keyword><keyword>Idaho</keyword><keyword>Mixed conifer forest</keyword><keyword>Differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR)</keyword><keyword>Landscape-context</keyword><keyword>NPMR</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0378-1127</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.foreco.2012.04.002</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We examined the effects of three early season (spring) prescribed fires on burn severity patterns of summer wildfires that occurred 1-3. years post-treatment in a mixed conifer forest in central Idaho. Wildfire and prescribed fire burn severities were estimated as the difference in normalized burn ratio (dNBR) using Landsat imagery. We used GIS derived vegetation, topography, and treatment variables to generate models predicting the wildfire burn severity of 1286-5500 30-m pixels within and around treated areas. We found that wildfire severity was significantly lower in treated areas than in untreated areas and significantly lower than the potential wildfire severity of the treated areas had treatments not been implemented. At the pixel level, wildfire severity was best predicted by an interaction between prescribed fire severity, topographic moisture, heat load, and pre-fire vegetation volume. Prescribed fire severity and vegetation volume were the most influential predictors. Prescribed fire severity, and its influence on wildfire severity, was highest in relatively warm and dry locations, which were able to burn under spring conditions. In contrast, wildfire severity peaked in cooler, more mesic locations that dried later in the summer and supported greater vegetation volume. We found considerable evidence that prescribed fires have landscape-level influences within treatment boundaries; most notable was an interaction between distance from the prescribed fire perimeter and distance from treated patch edges, which explained up to 66% of the variation in wildfire severity. Early season prescribed fires may not directly target the locations most at risk of high severity wildfire, but proximity of these areas to treated patches and the discontinuity of fuels following treatment may influence wildfire severity and explain how even low severity treatments can be effective management tools in fire-prone landscapes. © 2012.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70038466</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mitchell, Jessica J.</author><author>Glenn, Nancy F.</author><author>Sankey, Temuulen T.</author><author>Derryberry, De Wayne R</author><author>Germino, Matthew J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Remote sensing of sagebrush canopy nitrogen</title><secondary-title>Remote Sensing of Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Remote Sensing of Environment</full-title></periodical><pages>217-223</pages><volume>124</volume><keywords><keyword>Hyperspectral</keyword><keyword>Nitrogen</keyword><keyword>Continuum removal</keyword><keyword>Derivative analysis</keyword><keyword>Sagebrush</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0034-4257</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.rse.2012.05.002</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper presents a combination of techniques suitable for remotely sensing foliar Nitrogen (N) in semiarid shrublands - a capability that would significantly improve our limited understanding of vegetation functionality in dryland ecosystems. The ability to estimate foliar N distributions across arid and semi-arid environments could help answer process-driven questions related to topics such as controls on canopy photosynthesis, the influence of N on carbon cycling behavior, nutrient pulse dynamics, and post-fire recovery. Our study determined that further exploration into estimating sagebrush canopy N concentrations from an airborne platform is warranted, despite remote sensing challenges inherent to open canopy systems. Hyperspectral data transformed using standard derivative analysis were capable of quantifying sagebrush canopy N concentrations using partial least squares (PLS) regression with an R 2 value of 0.72 and an R 2 predicted value of 0.42 (n=35). Subsetting the dataset to minimize the influence of bare ground (n=19) increased R 2 to 0.95 (R 2 predicted=0.56). Ground-based estimates of canopy N using leaf mass per unit area measurements (LMA) yielded consistently better model fits than ground-based estimates of canopy N using cover and height measurements. The LMA approach is likely a method that could be extended to other semiarid shrublands. Overall, the results of this study are encouraging for future landscape scale N estimates and represent an important step in addressing the confounding influence of bare ground, which we found to be a major influence on predictions of sagebrush canopy N from an airborne platform. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70041489</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jonescheit, Linda</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Monitoring floods and fires during the summer of 2011--The value of the Landsat satellite 40-year archives</title></titles><pages>1-2</pages><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2012-3006</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/fs20123006</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wijayratne, Upekala C.</author><author>Pyke, David A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Burial increases seed longevity of two Artemisia tridentata (Asteraceae) subspecies</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Botany</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Botany</full-title></periodical><pages>438-447</pages><volume>99</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Restoration</keyword><keyword>Artemisia tridentata</keyword><keyword>Nondeep physiological dormancy</keyword><keyword>Seed burial</keyword><keyword>Seed longevity</keyword><keyword>Seed persistence</keyword><keyword>Soil seed bank</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0002-9122</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3732/ajb.1000477</electronic-resource-num><abstract>PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Seed longevity and persistence in soil seed banks may be especially important for population persistence in ecosystems where opportunities for seedling establishment and disturbance are unpredictable. The fire regime, an important driver of population dynamics in sagebrush steppe ecosystems, has been altered by exotic annual grass invasion. Soil seed banks may play an active role in postfire recovery of the foundation shrub Artemisia tridentata, yet conditions under which seeds persist are largely unknown.\n\nMETHODS: We investigated seed longevity of two Artemisia tridentata subspecies in situ by retrieving seed bags that were placed at varying depths over a 2 yr period. We also sampled naturally dispersed seeds in litter and soil immediately after seed dispersal and before flowering in subsequent seasons to estimate seed persistence.\n\nKEY RESULTS: After 24 mo, seeds buried at least 3 cm below the soil surface retained 30-40% viability whereas viability of seeds on the surface and under litter declined to 0 and &lt; 11%, respectively. The density of naturally dispersed seeds in the seed bank was highly heterogeneous both spatially and temporally, and attrition varied significantly by region.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that Artemisia tridentata has the potential to form a short-term soil seed bank that persists longer than has been commonly assumed, and that burial is necessary for seed longevity. Use of seeding techniques that promote burial of some seeds to aid in formation of a soil seed bank may increase restoration potential.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70041656</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ebel, Brian A.</author><author>Moody, John A.</author><author>Martin, Deborah A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hydrologic conditions controlling runoff generation immediately after wildfire</title><secondary-title>Water Resources Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Water Resources Research</full-title></periodical><volume>48</volume><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0043-1397</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011WR011470</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We investigated the control of postwildfire runoff by physical and hydraulic properties of soil, hydrologic states, and an ash layer immediately following wildfire. The field site is within the area burned by the 2010 Fourmile Canyon Fire in Colorado, USA. Physical and hydraulic property characterization included ash thickness, particle size distribution, hydraulic conductivity, and soil water retention curves. Soil water content and matric potential were measured indirectly at several depths below the soil surface to document hydrologic states underneath the ash layer in the unsaturated zone, whereas precipitation and surface runoff were measured directly. Measurements of soil water content showed that almost no water infiltrated below the ash layer into the near-surface soil in the burned site at the storm time scale (i.e., minutes to hours). Runoff generation processes were controlled by and highly sensitive to ash thickness and ash hydraulic properties. The ash layer stored from 97% to 99% of rainfall, which was critical for reducing runoff amounts. The hydrologic response to two rain storms with different rainfall amounts, rainfall intensity, and durations, only ten days apart, indicated that runoff generation was predominantly by the saturation-excess mechanism perched at the ash-soil interface during the first storm and predominantly by the infiltration-excess mechanism at the ash surface during the second storm. Contributing area was not static for the two storms and was 4% (saturation excess) to 68% (infiltration excess) of the catchment area. Our results showed the importance of including hydrologic conditions and hydraulic properties of the ash layer in postwildfire runoff generation models.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70038630</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Winter, Stephen L.</author><author>Fuhlendorf, Samuel D.</author><author>Goad, Carla L.</author><author>Davis, Craig A.</author><author>Hickman, Karen R.</author><author>Leslie, David M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Restoration of the fire-grazing interaction in Artemisia filifolia shrubland</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>242-250</pages><volume>49</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Conservation</keyword><keyword>Heterogeneity</keyword><keyword>Rangeland</keyword><keyword>Hierarchy</keyword><keyword>Patch burn</keyword><keyword>Pyric herbivory</keyword><keyword>Scale</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0021-8901</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02067.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>1. Patterns of landscape heterogeneity are crucial to the maintenance of biodiversity in shrublands and grasslands, yet management practices in these ecosystems typically seek to homogenize landscapes. Furthermore, there is limited understanding of how the interaction of ecological processes, such as fire and grazing, affects patterns of heterogeneity at different spatial scales. 2. We conducted research in Artemisia filifolia (Asteraceae) shrublands located in the southern Great Plains of North America to determine the effect of restoring the fire-grazing interaction on vegetation structure. Data were collected for 3 years in replicated pastures grazed by cattle Bos taurus where the fire-grazing interaction had been restored (fire and grazing = treatment pastures) and in pastures that were grazed but remained unburned (grazing only, no fire = control pastures). The effect of the fire-grazing interaction on heterogeneity (variance) of vegetation structure was assessed at scales from 12 5 m 2 to 609 ha. 3. Most measurements of vegetation structure within treatment pastures differed from control pastures for 1-3 years after being burned but were thereafter similar to the values found in unburned control pastures. 4. Treatment pastures were characterized by a lower amount of total heterogeneity and a lower amount of heterogeneity through time. 5. Heterogeneity of vegetation structure tended to decrease as the scale of measurement increased in both treatment and control pastures. There was deviation from this trend, however, in the treatment pastures that exhibited much higher heterogeneity at the patch scale (mean patch size = 202 ha) of measurement, the scale at which patch fires were conducted. 6. Synthesis and applications. Vegetation structure in A. filifolia shrublands of our study was readily altered by the fire-grazing interaction but also demonstrated substantial resilience to these effects. The fire-grazing interaction also changed the total amount of heterogeneity characterizing this system, the scale at which heterogeneity in this system was expressed and the amount of heterogeneity expressed through time. Land managers seeking to impose a shifting mosaic of heterogeneity on this vegetation type can do so by restoring the fire-grazing interaction with potential conservation benefits similar to what has been achieved in other ecosystems where historic cycles of disturbance and rest have been restored.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032569</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Xuexia</author><author>Giri, Chandra</author><author>Vogelmann, James</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Land-Cover Change Detection</title><secondary-title>Remote Sensing of Land Use and Land Cover</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Remote Sensing of Land Use and Land Cover</full-title></periodical><pages>153-176</pages><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>CRC Press</publisher><isbn>978-1-4200-7075-0</isbn><abstract>Filling the need for a comprehensive book that covers both theory and application, Remote Sensing of Land Use and Land Cover: Principles and Applications provides a synopsis of how remote sensing can be used for land-cover characterization, mapping, and monitoring from the local to the global scale.

We measured soil-water retention curves on intact cores and repacked samples, soil particle-size distributions, and organic matter content. Estimates were also made of plant-available water based on the soil-water retention curves. Parameters for use in soil-hydraulic property models were estimated; these parameters can be used in unsaturated flow modeling for comparing burned and unburned watersheds. The primary driver for measured differences in soil-water retention in burned and unburned soils was organic matter content and not soil-particle size distribution. The tendency for unburned south-facing soils to have greater organic matter content than unburned north-facing soils in this field area may explain why unburned south-facing soils had greater soil-water retention than unburned north-facing soils. Our results suggest that high-severity wildfire can “homogenize” soil-water retention across the landscape by erasing soil-water retention differences resulting from organic matter content, which for this site may be affected by slope aspect. This homogenization could have important implications for ecohydrology and plant succession/recovery in burned areas, which could be a factor in dictating the window of vulnerability of the landscape to flash floods and erosion that are a common consequence of wildfire.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70182181</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Belnap, Jayne</author><author>Ludwig, John A.</author><author>Wilcox, Bradford P.</author><author>Betancourt, Julio L.</author><author>Dean, W.

Whereas many rangeland stakeholders (people who use or have an interest in rangelands) view intentional species introductions to improve forage and control erosion as beneficial, others focus on unintended costs, such as increased fire risk, loss of rangeland biodiversity, and threats to conservation efforts, specifically in nature reserves and parks. These conflicting views challenge all rangeland stakeholders, especially those making decisions on how best to manage novel ecosystems. To formulate a conceptual framework for decision making, we examined a wide range of novel ecosystems, created by intentional and unintentional introductions of nonnative species and land-use-facilitated spread of native ones. This framework simply divides decision making into two types: 1) straightforward-certain, and 2) complex-uncertain. We argue that management decisions to retain novel ecosystems are certain when goods and services provided by the system far outweigh the costs of restoration, for example in the case of intensively managed Cenchrus pastures. Decisions to return novel ecosystems to natural systems are also certain when the value of the system is low and restoration is easy and inexpensive as in the case of biocontrol of Opuntia infestations. In contrast, decisions whether to retain or restore novel ecosystems become complex and uncertain in cases where benefits are low and costs of control are high as, for example, in the case of stopping the expansion of Prosopis and Juniperus into semiarid rangelands. Decisions to retain or restore novel ecosystems are also complex and uncertain when, for example, nonnative Eucalyptus trees expand along natural streams, negatively affecting biodiversity, but also providing timber and honey. When decision making is complex and uncertain, we suggest that rangeland managers utilize cost-benefit analyses and hold stakeholder workshops to resolve conflicts.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70043877</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Powers, Matthew D.</author><author>Kolka, Randall K.</author><author>Bradford, John B.</author><author>Palik, Brian J.</author><author>Fraver, Shawn</author><author>Jurgensen, Martin F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Carbon stocks across a chronosequence of thinned and unmanaged red pine (Pinus resinosa) stands</title><secondary-title>Ecological Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>1297-1307</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Thinning</keyword><keyword>Forest management</keyword><keyword>Carbon dynamics</keyword><keyword>Carbon storage</keyword><keyword>Chippewa National Forest, Minnesota, USA</keyword><keyword>Pinus resinosa</keyword><keyword>Red pine</keyword><keyword>Stand age</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1051-0761</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1890/11-0411.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Forests function as a major global C sink, and forest management strategies that maximize C stocks offer one possible means of mitigating the impacts of increasing anthropogenic CO2 emissions. We studied the effects of thinning, a common management technique in many forest types, on age-related trends in C stocks using a chronosequence of thinned and unmanaged red pine (Pinus resinosa) stands ranging from 9 to 306 years old. Live tree C stocks increased with age to a maximum near the middle of the chronosequence in unmanaged stands, and increased across the entire chronosequence in thinned stands. C in live understory vegetation and C in the mineral soil each declined rapidly with age in young stands but changed relatively little in middle-aged to older stands regardless of management. Forest floor C stocks increased with age in unmanaged stands, but forest floor C decreased with age after the onset of thinning around age 40 in thinned stands. Deadwood C was highly variable, but decreased with age in thinned stands. Total ecosystem C increased with stand age until approaching an asymptote around age 150. The increase in total ecosystem C was paralleled by an age-related increase in total aboveground C, but relatively little change in total belowground C. Thinning had surprisingly little impact on total ecosystem C stocks, but it did modestly alter age-related trends in total ecosystem C allocation between aboveground and belowground pools. In addition to characterizing the subtle differences in C dynamics between thinned and unmanaged stands, these results suggest that C accrual in red pine stands continues well beyond the 60-100 year management rotations typical for this system. Management plans that incorporate longer rotations and thinning in some stands could play an important role in maximizing C stocks in red pine forests while meeting other objectives including timber extraction, biodiversity conservation, restoration, and fuel reduction goals.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70041599</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Olsson, A.

Accurate prediction and successful mitigation of these invasions hinge on estimation of spread rates and their degree of constancy in time and space. We used high-resolution aerial photographs from 11 sites in the Santa Catalina Mountains, southern Arizona to reconstruct the spread of buffelgrass (Pennisetum ciliare), a C 4 perennial bunchgrass, since 1980. The total area infested was fit to a logistic model and residuals of the model were compared to climatic factors of the corresponding and lagged time periods. Infestations grew from small colonizing patches in the 1980s to 66 ha in 2008, doubling every 2.26-7.04 years since 1988. Although buffelgrass germination, establishment and distribution are favored by wet summers and warm winters, climate variables did not predict spread rates. Buffelgrass has grown at a constant rate, at least since 1988, when much of its expansion took place. In the study area, minimum requirements are met almost every year for germination and reproduction, establishing a consistent baseline for spread that manifests as a constant spread rate. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70004664</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sankey, Joel B.</author><author>Germino, Matthew J.</author><author>Benner, Shawn G.</author><author>Glenn, Nancy F.</author><author>Hoover, Amber N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transport of biologically important nutrients by wind in an eroding cold desert</title><secondary-title>Aeolian Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Aeolian Research</full-title></periodical><pages>17-27</pages><volume>7</volume><keywords><keyword>Fire</keyword><keyword>Wind erosion</keyword><keyword>Aeolian</keyword><keyword>Nutrients</keyword><keyword>Sagebrush steppe</keyword><keyword>Water</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.aeolia.2012.01.003</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Wind erosion following fire is an important landscape process that can result in the redistribution of ecologically important soil resources. In this study we evaluated the potential for a fire patch in a desert shrubland to serve as a source of biologically important nutrients to the adjacent, downwind, unburned ecosystem. We analyzed nutrient concentrations (P, K, Ca, Mg, Cu, Fe, Mn, Al) in wind-transported sediments, and soils from burned and adjacent unburned surfaces, collected during the first to second growing seasons after a wildfire that burned in 2007 in Idaho, USA in sagebrush steppe; a type of cold desert shrubland. We also evaluated the timing of potential wind erosion events and weather conditions that might have contributed to nutrient availability in downwind shrubland. Findings indicated that post-fire wind erosion resulted in an important, but transient, addition of nutrients on the downwind shrubland. Aeolian sediments from the burned area were enriched relative to both the up- and down-wind soil and indicated the potential for a fertilization effect through the deposition of the nutrient-enriched sediment during the first, but not second, summer after wildfire. Weather conditions that could have produced nutrient transport events might have provided increased soil moisture necessary to make nutrients accessible for plants in the desert environment. Wind transport of nutrients following fire is likely important in the sagebrush steppe as it could contribute to pulses of resource availability that might, for example, affect plant species differently depending on their phenology, and nutrient- and water-use requirements. © 2012.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70038239</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Soulard, Christopher E.</author><author>Sleeter, Benjamin M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Late twentieth century land-cover change in the basin and range ecoregions of the United States</title><secondary-title>Regional Environmental Change</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Regional Environmental Change</full-title></periodical><pages>813-823</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire</keyword><keyword>Land use</keyword><keyword>Development</keyword><keyword>Great Basin</keyword><keyword>Mojave</keyword><keyword>Sonoran</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1011301202</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10113-012-0296-3</electronic-resource-num><abstract>As part of the US Geological Survey’s Land Cover Trends project, land-use/land-cover change esti- mates between 1973 and 2000 are presented for the basin and range ecoregions, including Northern, Central, Mojave, and Sonoran. Landsat data were employed to estimate and characterize land-cover change from 1973, 1980, 1986, 1992, and 2000 using a post-classification comparison. Overall, spatial change was 2.5% (17,830 km2). Change increased steadily between 1973 and 1986 but decreased slightly between 1992 and 2000. The grassland/shrubland class, frequently used for livestock grazing, constituted the majority of the study area and had a net decrease from an estimated 83.8% (587,024 km2) in 1973 to 82.6% (578,242 km2) in 2000. The most common land-use/land- cover conversions across the basin and range ecoregions were indicative of the changes associated with natural, nonmechanical disturbances (i.e., fire), and grassland/ shrubland loss to development, agriculture, and mining. This comprehensive look at contemporary land-use/land- cover change provides critical insight into how the deserts of the United States have changed and can be used to inform adaptive management practices of public lands.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70037787</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cochrane, M.

Mitigation of potential fire behaviour and fire severity have increasingly been attempted through pre-fire alteration of wildland fuels using mechanical treatments and prescribed fires. Despite annual treatment of more than a million hectares of land, quantitative assessments of the effectiveness of existing fuel treatments at reducing the size of actual wildfires or how they might alter the risk of burning across landscapes are currently lacking. Here, we present a method for estimating spatial probabilities of burning as a function of extant fuels treatments for any wildland fire-affected landscape. We examined the landscape effects of more than 72 000 ha of wildland fuel treatments involved in 14 large wildfires that burned 314 000 ha of forests in nine US states between 2002 and 2010. Fuels treatments altered the probability of fire occurrence both positively and negatively across landscapes, effectively redistributing fire risk by changing surface fire spread rates and reducing the likelihood of crowning behaviour. Trade offs are created between formation of large areas with low probabilities of increased burning and smaller, well-defined regions with reduced fire risk.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70043104</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Parise, M.</author><author>Cannon, S.

Wildfires can have profound effects on the hydrologic response of watersheds by changing the infiltration characteristics and erod- ibility of the soil, which leads to decreased rainfall infiltration, significantly increased overland flow and runoff in channels, and movement of soil. Debris-flow activity is among the most destructive consequences of these changes, often causing extensive damage to human infrastructure. Data from the Mediterranean area and Western United States of America help identify the primary processes that result in debris flows in recently burned areas. Two primary processes for the initiation of fire-related debris flows have been so far identified: (1) runoff-dominated erosion by surface overland flow; and (2) infiltration- triggered failure and mobilization of a discrete landslide mass. The first process is fre- quently documented immediately post-fire and leads to the generation of debris flows through progressive bulking of storm runoff with sediment eroded from the hillslopes and channels. As sediment is incorporated into water, runoff can convert to debris flow. The conversion to debris flow may be observed at a position within a drainage network that appears to be controlled by threshold values of upslope contributing area and its gradient. At these locations, sufficient eroded material has been incorporated, relative to the volume of contributing surface runoff, to generate debris flows. Debris flows have also been generated from burned basins in response to increased runoff by water cascading over a steep, bedrock cliff, and incorporating material from readily erodible colluvium or channel bed. Post-fire debris flows have also been generated by infiltration-triggered landslide failures which then mobilize into debris flows. However, only 12% of documented cases exhibited this process. When they do occur, the landslide failures range in thickness from a few tens of centimeters to more than 6 m, and generally involve the soil and colluvium- mantled hillslopes. Surficial landslide failures in burned areas most frequently occur in response to prolonged periods of storm rainfall, or prolonged rainfall in combination with rapid snowmelt or rain-on-snow events.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032254</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Andrews, William J.</author><author>Masoner, Jason R.</author><author>Cozzarelli, Isabelle M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Emerging contaminants at a closed and an operating landfill in Oklahoma</title><secondary-title>Ground Water Monitoring and Remediation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ground Water Monitoring and Remediation</full-title></periodical><pages>120-130</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0039-3665 (Print)\n0039-3665 (Linking)</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1745-6592.2011.01373.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Landfills are the final depositories for a wide range of solid waste from both residential and commercial sources, and therefore have the potential to produce leachate containing many organic compounds found in consumer products such as pharmaceuticals, plasticizers, disinfectants, cleaning agents, fire retardants, flavorings, and preservatives, known as emerging contaminants (ECs). Landfill leachate was sampled from landfill cells of three different age ranges from two landfills in Central Oklahoma. Samples were collected from an old cell containing solid waste greater than 25 years old, an intermediate age cell with solid waste between 16 and 3 years old, and operating cell with solid waste less than 5 years old to investigate the chemical variability and persistence of selected ECs in landfill leachate of differing age sources. Twenty-eight of 69 analyzed ECs were detected in one or more samples from the three leachate sources. Detected ECs ranged in concentration from 0.11 to 114 μg/L and included 4 fecal and plant sterols, 13 householdındustrial, 7 hydrocarbon, and 4 pesticide compounds. Four ECs were solely detected in the oldest leachate sample, two ECs were solely detected in the intermediate leachate sample, and no ECs were solely detected in the youngest leachate sample. Eleven ECs were commonly detected in all three leachate samples and are an indication of the contents of solid waste deposited over several decades and the relative resistance of some ECs to natural attenuation processes in and near landfills.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70046850</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keeley, Jon E</author><author>Bond, William J</author><author>Bradstock, Ross A</author><author>Pausas, Juli G</author><author>Rundel, Philip W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mediterranean-type climate ecosystems and fire</title><secondary-title>Fire in Mediterranean ecosystems: ecology, evolution and management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Fire in Mediterranean ecosystems: ecology, evolution and management</full-title></periodical><pages>3-29</pages><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Cambridge, UK</pub-location><publisher>Cambridge University Press</publisher><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70157936</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keeley, JE</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fire in mediterranean climate ecosystems—a comparative overview</title><secondary-title>Israel Journal of Ecology &amp; Evolution</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Israel Journal of Ecology &amp; Evolution</full-title></periodical><pages>37-41</pages><volume>9801</volume><issue>August 2013</issue><keywords><keyword>fire</keyword><keyword>chaparral</keyword><keyword>convergent evolution</keyword><keyword>fynbos</keyword><keyword>heathlands</keyword><keyword>mator-</keyword><keyword>postfire seeders</keyword><keyword>ral</keyword><keyword>resprouters</keyword><keyword>serotiny</keyword><keyword>_Invalid DOI</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1565-9801</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1560/IJEE.58.2-3.123</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Four regions of the world share a similar climate and structurally similar plant communities with the Mediterranean Basin. These five areas, known collectively as “mediterranean-type climate (MTC) regions”, are dominat- ed by evergreen sclerophyllous-leaved shrublands, semi-deciduous scrub, and woodlands, all of which are prone to widespread crown fires. Summer droughts produce an annual fire hazard that contributes to a highly predict- able fire regime. Fire has been an important factor driving the convergence of these systems and is reflected in plant traits such as lignotubers in resprouting shrubs and delayed reproduction that restricts recruitment to a postfire pulse of seedlings. On fertile soils where postfire resprouting is very rapid, opportu - nities for postfire seedling recruitment are limited and thus these woody taxa have not opted for delaying reproduction. Such fire-independent recruitment is widespread in the floras of MTC regions of the Mediterranean Basin and California and postfire seeding tends to dominate at the more arid end of the gradient. Due to very different geological histories in South Africa and West- ern Australia, substrates are nutrient poor and thus postfire resprouters do not pose a similar competitive challenge to seedlings and thus postfire seeding is very widespread in these floras. Although circumstantial evidence suggests that the MTC region of Chile had fire-prone landscapes in the Tertiary, these were lost with the late Miocene completion of the Andean uplift, which now blocks summer lightning storms from moving into the region. Today these five regions pose a significant fire management challenge due to the annual fire hazard and metropolitan centers juxtaposed with highly flammable vege - tation. This challenge varies across the five MTC landscapes as a function of differences in regional fuel loads and population density.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70124276</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yuan, F.

In this study we applied a large-scale ecosystem model that included dynamics of organic soil horizons and soil organic matter characteristics of multiple pools to assess forest C stock changes of the Yukon River Basin (YRB) in Alaska, USA, and Canada from 1960 through 2006, a period characterized by substantial climate warming and increases in wildfire. The model was calibrated for major forests with data from long-term research sites and evaluated using a forest inventory database. The regional assessment indicates that forest vegetation C storage increased by 46 Tg C, but that total soil C storage did not change appreciably during this period. However, further analysis suggests that C has been continuously lost from the mineral soil horizon since warming began in the 1970s, but has increased in the amorphous organic soil horizon. Based on a factorial experiment, soil C stocks would have increased by 158 Tg C if the YRB had not undergone warming and changes in fire regime. The analysis also identified that warming and changes in fire regime were approximately equivalent in their effects on soil C storage, and interactions between these two suggests that the loss of organic horizon thickness associated with increases in wildfire made deeper soil C stocks more vulnerable to loss via decomposition. Subbasin analyses indicate that C stock changes were primarily sensitive to the fraction of burned forest area within each subbasin and that boreal forest ecosystems in the YRB are currently transitioning from being sinks to sources at -0.7% annual area burned. We conclude that it is important for international mitigation efforts focused on controlling atmospheric CO2 to consider how climate warming and changes in fire regime may concurrently affect the CO2 sink strength of boreal forests. It is also important for large-scale biogeochemical and earth system models to include organic soil dynamics in applications to assess regional C dynamics of boreal forests responding to warming and changes in fire regime.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70118262</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Price, Owen F.</author><author>Bradstock, Ross A.</author><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author><author>Syphard, Alexandra D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The impact of antecedent fire area on burned area in southern California coastal ecosystems</title><secondary-title>Journal of Environmental Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Environmental Management</full-title></periodical><pages>301-307</pages><volume>113</volume><keywords><keyword>Prescribed fire</keyword><keyword>Fire management</keyword><keyword>Chaparral</keyword><keyword>Leverage</keyword><keyword>Risk management</keyword><keyword>Santa ana</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1095-8630 (Electronic)\r0301-4797 (Linking)</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jenvman.2012.08.042</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Frequent wildfire disasters in southern California highlight the need for risk reduction strategies for the region, of which fuel reduction via prescribed burning is one option. However, there is no consensus about the effectiveness of prescribed fire in reducing the area of wildfire. Here, we use 29 years of historical fire mapping to quantify the relationship between annual wildfire area and antecedent fire area in predominantly shrub and grassland fuels in seven southern California counties, controlling for annual variation in weather patterns. This method has been used elsewhere to measure leverage: the reduction in wildfire area resulting from one unit of prescribed fire treatment. We found little evidence for a leverage effect (leverage = zero). Specifically our results showed no evidence that wildfire area was negatively influenced by previous fires, and only weak relationships with weather variables rainfall and Santa Ana wind occurrences, which were variables included to control for inter-annual variation. We conclude that this is because only 2% of the vegetation burns each year and so wildfires rarely encounter burned patches and chaparral shrublands can carry a fire within 1 or 2 years after previous fire. Prescribed burning is unlikely to have much influence on fire regimes in this area, though targeted treatment at the urban interface may be effective at providing defensible space for protecting assets. These results fit an emerging global model of fire leverage which position California at the bottom end of a continuum, with tropical savannas at the top (leverage = 1: direct replacement of wildfire by prescribed fire) and Australian eucalypt forests in the middle (leverage ∼ 0.25). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70178820</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schwilk, Dylan W.</author><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A plant distribution shift: Temperature, drought or past disturbance?</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><volume>7</volume><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1932-6203 (Electronic)\r1932-6203 (Linking)</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0031173</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Simple models of plant response to warming climates predict vegetation moving to cooler and/or wetter locations: in mountainous regions shifting upslope. However, species-specific responses to climate change are likely to be much more complex. We re-examined a recently reported vegetation shift in the Santa Rosa Mountains, California, to better understand the mechanisms behind the reported shift of a plant distribution upslope. We focused on five elevational zones near the center of the gradient that captured many of the reported shifts and which are dominated by fire-prone chaparral. Using growth rings, we determined that a major assumption of the previous work was wrong: past fire histories differed among elevations. To examine the potential effect that this difference might have on the reported upward shift, we focused on one species, Ceanothus greggii: a shrub that only recruits post-fire from a soil stored seedbank. For five elevations used in the prior study, we calculated time series of past per-capita mortality rates by counting growth rings on live and dead individuals. We tested three alternative hypotheses explaining the past patterns of mortality: 1) mortality increased over time consistent with climate warming, 2) mortality was correlated with drought indices, and 3) mortality peaked 40-50 years post fire at each site, consistent with self-thinning. We found that the sites were different ages since the last fire, and that the reported increase in the mean elevation of C. greggii was due to higher recent mortality at the lower elevations, which were younger sites. The time-series pattern of mortality was best explained by the self-thinning hypothesis and poorly explained by gradual warming or drought. At least for this species, the reported distribution shift appears to be an artifact of disturbance history and is not evidence of a climate warming effect.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70032373</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Warrick, J.

Here, we compile discharge and suspended- sediment sampling data from before and after the fi res and show that the effects of the postfi re responses differed markedly. The 1977 Marble Cone wildfi re was followed by an exceptionally wet winter, which resulted in concentrations and fl uxes of both fi ne and coarse suspended sediment that were ~35 times greater than average (sediment yield during the 1978 water year was 11,000 t/km2/yr). We suggest that the combined 1977–1978 fi re and fl ood had a recurrence interval of greater than 1000 yr. In contrast, the 2008 Basin Complex wildfi re was followed by a drier than normal year, and although suspended-sediment fl uxes and concentrations were signifi cantly elevated compared to those expected for unburned conditions, the sediment yield during the 2009 water year was less than 1% of the post–Marble Cone wildfi re yield. After the fi rst postfi re winters, sediment concentrations and yield decreased with time toward prefi re relationships and continued to have signifi cant rainfall dependence. We hypothesize that the differences in sediment yield were related to precipitationenhanced hillslope erosion processes, such as rilling and mass movements. The millennialscale effects of wildfi re on sediment yield were explored further using Monte Carlo simulations, and these analyses suggest that infrequent wildfi res followed by fl oods increase long-term suspended-sediment fl uxes markedly. Thus, we suggest that the current approach of estimating sediment yield from sediment rating curves and discharge data— without including periodic perturbations from wildfi res—may grossly underestimate actual sediment yields.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70100649</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Syphard, Alexandra D.</author><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author><author>Massada, Avi Bar</author><author>Brennan, Teresa J.</author><author>Radeloff, Volker C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Housing arrangement and location determine the likelihood of housing loss due to wildfire</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><volume>7</volume><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1932-6203</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0033954</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Surging wildfires across the globe are contributing to escalating residential losses and have major social, economic, and ecological consequences. The highest losses in the U.S. occur in southern California, where nearly 1000 homes per year have been destroyed by wildfires since 2000. Wildfire risk reduction efforts focus primarily on fuel reduction and, to a lesser degree, on house characteristics and homeowner responsibility. However, the extent to which land use planning could alleviate wildfire risk has been largely missing from the debate despite large numbers of homes being placed in the most hazardous parts of the landscape. Our goal was to examine how housing location and arrangement affects the likelihood that a home will be lost when a wildfire occurs. We developed an extensive geographic dataset of structure locations, including more than 5500 structures that were destroyed or damaged by wildfire since 2001, and identified the main contributors to property loss in two extensive, fire-prone regions in southern California. The arrangement and location of structures strongly affected their susceptibility to wildfire, with property loss most likely at low to intermediate structure densities and in areas with a history of frequent fire. Rates of structure loss were higher when structures were surrounded by wildland vegetation, but were generally higher in herbaceous fuel types than in higher fuel-volume woody types. Empirically based maps developed using housing pattern and location performed better in distinguishing hazardous from non-hazardous areas than maps based on fuel distribution. The strong importance of housing arrangement and location indicate that land use planning may be a critical tool for reducing fire risk, but it will require reliable delineations of the most hazardous locations.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70039023</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Roberts, Suzanne C</author><author>Brooks, Matthew L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>California spotted owls: Chapter 5 in Managing Sierra Nevada forests</title></titles><pages>61-71</pages><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Albany, CA</pub-location><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70123981</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Herrick, J.

Efforts to increase land productivity include conversion of millions of hectares of rangelands to crop production, including many marginal lands with low resistance and resilience to degradation. Sustaining the productivity of these lands requires careful land use planning and innovative management systems. Historically, this responsibility has been left to agronomists and others with expertise in crop production. In this article, we argue that the revolutionary land use changes necessary to support national and global food security potentially make rangeland science more relevant now than ever. Maintaining and increasing relevance will require a revolutionary change in range science from a discipline that focuses on a particular land use or land cover to one that addresses the challenge of managing all lands that, at one time, were considered to be marginal for crop production. We propose four strategies to increase the relevance of rangeland science to global land management: 1) expand our awareness and understanding of local to global economic, social, and technological trends in order to anticipate and identify drivers and patterns of conversion; 2) emphasize empirical studies and modeling that anticipate the biophysical (ecosystem services) and societal consequences of large-scale changes in land cover and use; 3) significantly increase communication and collaboration with the disciplines and sectors of society currently responsible for managing the new land uses; and 4) develop and adopt a dynamic and flexible resilience-based land classification system and data-supported conceptual models (e.g., state-and-transition models) that represent all lands, regardless of use and the consequences of land conversion to various uses instead of changes in state or condition that are focused on a single land use.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70041481</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nussear, Kenneth E</author><author>Drake, Karla K</author><author>Medica, Phil A</author><author>Esque, Todd C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Gopherus agassizii (Agassiz’s desert tortoise). scute dysecdysis/scute sloughing</title><secondary-title>Herpetological Review</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Herpetological Review</full-title></periodical><pages>473-474</pages><volume>43</volume><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70042774</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Homer, Collin G.</author><author>Aldridge, Cameron L.</author><author>Meyer, Debra K.</author><author>Schell, Spencer J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multi-scale remote sensing sagebrush characterization with regression trees over Wyoming, USA: Laying a foundation for monitoring</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation</full-title></periodical><pages>233-244</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Monitoring</keyword><keyword>Sagebrush</keyword><keyword>Rangeland remote sensing</keyword><keyword>Regression tree classification</keyword><keyword>Wyoming</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0303-2434</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jag.2011.09.012</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Sagebrush ecosystems in North America have experienced extensive degradation since European settlement. Further degradation continues from exotic invasive plants, altered fire frequency, intensive grazing practices, oil and gas development, and climate change - adding urgency to the need for ecosystem-wide understanding. Remote sensing is often identified as a key information source to facilitate ecosystemwide characterization, monitoring, and analysis; however, approaches that characterize sagebrush with sufficient and accurate local detail across large enough areas to support this paradigm are unavailable. We describe the development of a new remote sensing sagebrush characterization approach for the state of Wyoming, U.S.A. This approach integrates 2.4 m QuickBird, 30 m Landsat TM, and 56 m AWiFS imagery into the characterization of four primary continuous field components including percent bare ground, percent herbaceous cover, percent litter, and percent shrub, and four secondary components including percent sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), percent big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), percent Wyoming sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Wyomingensis), and shrub height using a regression tree. According to an independent accuracy assessment, primary component root mean square error (RMSE) values ranged from 4.90 to 10.16 for 2.4 m QuickBird, 6.01 to 15.54 for 30 m Landsat, and 6.97 to 16.14 for 56 m AWiFS. Shrub and herbaceous components outperformed the current data standard called LANDFIRE, with a shrub RMSE value of 6.04 versus 12.64 and a herbaceous component RMSE value of 12.89 versus 14.63. This approach offers new advancements in sagebrush characterization from remote sensing and provides a foundation to quantitatively monitor these components into the future. © 2011.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70043303</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reynolds, M.

Understanding plant establishment dynamics is important for mitigating the impacts of disturbances and promoting revegetation. •\n\nMETHODS: We placed Y. brevifolia seeds in shallow caches and manipulated granivore access, nurse shrub effects, and the season of cache placement to determine conditions for seed germination and seedling establishment. •\n\nKEY RESULTS: Greatest seedling emergence occurred during spring and summer, when increased soil moisture was accompanied by warm soil temperatures. Late winter-spring emergence for cached seeds was enhanced beneath shrub canopies, but seedling survival declined beneath shrubs as temperatures increased in spring. Germinability of seed remaining in the soil was reduced from 50-68% after 12 mo residence time in soil and declined to &lt;3% after 40 mo. Following dispersal from parent plants, seeds are either removed by granivores or lose germinability, imposing substantial losses of potential germinants. •\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Specific germination and establishment requirements impose stringent limits on recruitment rates for Y. brevifolia. Coupled with infrequent seed availability, the return rates to prefire densities and demographic structure may require decades to centuries, especially in light of potential changes to regional desert climate in combination with the potential for fire recurrence. Demographic patterns are predicted to vary spatially in response to environmental variability that limits recruitment and may already be apparent among extant populations.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70044371</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Watts, Adam C.</author><author>Kobziar, Leda N.</author><author>Snyder, James R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fire reinforces structure of pondcypress (taxodium distichum var. imbricarium) domes in a wetland landscape</title><secondary-title>Wetlands</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Wetlands</full-title></periodical><pages>439-448</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Delayed mortality</keyword><keyword>Fire severity</keyword><keyword>Edge effect</keyword><keyword>Logistic regression</keyword><keyword>Patch size</keyword><keyword>Wetland forest</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0277-5212</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s13157-012-0277-9</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fire periodically affects wetland forests, particularly in landscapes with extensive fire-prone uplands. Rare occurrence and difficulty of access have limited efforts to understand impacts of wildfires fires in wetlands. Following a 2009 wildfire, we measured tree mortality and structural changes in wetland forest patches. Centers of these circular landscape features experienced lower fire severity, although no continuous patch-size or edge effect was evident. Initial survival of the dominant tree, pondcypress (Taxodium distichum var. imbricarium), was high (&gt;99%), but within one year of the fire approximately 23% of trees died. Delayed mortality was correlated with fire severity, but unrelated to other hypothesized factors such as patch size or edge distance. Tree diameter and soil elevation were important predictors of mortality, with smaller trees and those in areas with lower elevation more likely to die following severe fire. Depressional cypress forests typically exhibit increasing tree size towards their interiors, and differential mortality patterns were related to edge distance. These patterns result in the exaggeration of a dome-shaped profile. Our observations quantify roles of fire and hydrology in determining cypress mortality in these swamps, and imply the existence of feedbacks that maintain the characteristic shape of cypress domes. © Society of Wetland Scientists 2012.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70038885</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bar-Massada, Avi</author><author>Hawbaker, Todd J.</author><author>Stewart, Susan I.</author><author>Radeloff, Volker C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Combining satellite-based fire observations and ground-based lightning detections to identify lightning fires across the conterminous USA</title><secondary-title>IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing</full-title></periodical><pages>1438-1447</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire</keyword><keyword>MODIS</keyword><keyword>lightning</keyword><keyword>NLDN</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>October 2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1939-1404</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/JSTARS.2012.2193665</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Lightning fires are a common natural disturbance in North America, and\naccount for the largest proportion of the area burned by wildfires each\nyear. Yet, the spatiotemporal patterns of lightning fires in the\nconterminous US are not well understood due to limitations of existing\nfire databases. Our goal here was to develop and test an algorithm that\ncombined MODIS fire detections with lightning detections from the\nNational Lightning Detection Network to identify lightning fires across\nthe conterminous US from 2000 to 2008. The algorithm searches for\nspatiotemporal conjunctions of MODIS fire clusters and NLDN detected\nlightning strikes, given a spatiotemporal lag between lightning strike\nand fire ignition. The algorithm revealed distinctive spatial patterns\nof lightning fires in the conterminous US While a sensitivity analysis\nrevealed that the algorithm is highly sensitive to the two thresholds\nthat are used to determine conjunction, the density of fires it detected\nwas moderately correlated with ground based fire records. When only\nfires larger than 0.4 km(2) were considered, correlations were higher\nand the root-mean-square error between datasets was less than five fires\nper 625 km(2) for the entire study period. Our algorithm is thus\nsuitable for detecting broad scale spatial patterns of lightning fire\noccurrence, and especially lightning fire hotspots, but has limited\ndetection capability of smaller fires because these cannot be\nconsistently detected by MODIS. These results may enhance our\nunderstanding of large scale patterns of lightning fire activity, and\ncan be used to identify the broad scale factors controlling fire\noccurrence.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6184334/</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Murphy, Sheila F</author><author>Mccleskey, R Blaine</author><author>Writer, Jeffrey H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of flow regime on stream turbidity and suspended solids after wildfire , Colorado Front Range</title></titles><periodical><full-title>Wildfire and Water Quality: Processes, Impacts and Challenges</full-title></periodical><pages>11-14</pages><keywords><keyword>wildfire</keyword><keyword>colorado front range</keyword><keyword>flow regime</keyword><keyword>fourmile canyon fire</keyword><keyword>turbidity</keyword><keyword>water quality</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>978-1-907161-32-2</isbn><abstract>Wildfires occur frequently in the Colorado Front Range and can alter the hydrological response of watersheds, yet little information exists on the impact of flow regime and storm events on post-wildfire water quality.

Needs assessments conducted by consortia in eight regions of the United States are synthesized here using a case survey approach. Although regions used different methods based on their different ecosystems, geography, and demography, results showed striking similarities in how fire science is accessed and used, barriers to its use, and research information needed. Use of Internet-based information is universally high; however, in-person knowledge exchange is preferred. Obstacles to fire science application include lack of time, resources, and access to the most relevant information as well as communication barriers between scientists and managers. Findings show a clear need for boundary organizations to span fire science and management to (a) organize and consolidate fire science information through easily accessible websites and (b) strengthen relationships between scientists and managers to facilitate production and communication of science relevant to managers' concerns. This article contributes to boundary spanning theory by underscoring and documenting the advantages of regionally focused boundary organizations in meeting user needs and building bridges between fire scientists and managers.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/xref?genre=article&amp;issn=0022-1201&amp;volume=110&amp;issue=8&amp;spage=421</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Writer, Jh</author><author>McCleskey, Rb</author><author>Murphy, Sf</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of wildfire on source-water quality and aquatic ecosystems, Colorado Front Range</title></titles><periodical><full-title>Wildfire and Water Quality: Processes, Impacts, and Challenges</full-title></periodical><pages>117-123</pages><keywords><keyword>wildfire</keyword><keyword>colorado front range</keyword><keyword>dissolved organic carbon</keyword><keyword>sediment</keyword><keyword>source-water quality</keyword><keyword>stream biofilms</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>978-1-907161-32-2</isbn><abstract>Watershed erosion can dramatically increase after wildfire, but limited research has evaluated the corresponding influence on source-water quality. This study evaluated the effects of the Fourmile Canyon wildfire (Colorado Front Range, USA.) on source-water quality and aquatic ecosystems using high-frequency sampling. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nutrient loads in stream water were evaluated for a one-year period during different types of runoff events, including spring snowmelt, and both frontal and summer convective storms. DOC export from the burned watershed did not increase relative to the unburned watershed during spring snowmelt, but substantial increases in DOC export were observed during summer convective storms. Elevated nutrient export from the burned watershed was observed during spring snowmelt and summer convective storms, which increased the primary productivity of stream biofilms.

phenomenon that is expected to increase in extent and severity in the future, due to fuel accumulations, shifting land management practices, and climate change. It immediately affects the landscape by removing vegetation, depositing ash, influencing water-repellent soil formation, and physically weathering boulders and bedrock. These changes typically lead to increased erosion through sheetwash, rilling, dry ravel, and increased mass movement in the form of floods, debris flow, rockfall, and landslides. These process changes bring about landform changes as hillslopes are lowered and stream channels aggrade or incise at increased rates. Furthermore, development of alluvial fans, debris fans, and talus cones are enhanced. The window of disturbance to the landscape caused by wildfire is typically on the order of three to four years, with some effects persisting up to 30 years. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

With projections of climate change and housing growth potentially exacerbating the threat of wildfire to homes and property, effective fire-risk reduction alternatives are needed as part of a comprehensive fire management plan. Land use planning represents a shift in traditional thinking from trying to eliminate wildfires, or even increasing resilience to them, toward avoiding exposure to them through the informed placement of new residential structures. For land use planning to be effective, it needs to be based on solid understanding of where and how to locate and arrange new homes. We simulated three scenarios of future residential development and projected landscape-level wildfire risk to residential structures in a rapidly urbanizing, fire-prone region in southern California. We based all future development on an econometric subdivision model, but we varied the emphasis of subdivision decision-making based on three broad and common growth types: infill, expansion, and leapfrog. Simulation results showed that decision-making based on these growth types, when applied locally for subdivision of individual parcels, produced substantial landscape-level differences in pattern, location, and extent of development. These differences in development, in turn, affected the area and proportion of structures at risk from burning in wildfires. Scenarios with lower housing density and larger numbers of small, isolated clusters of development, i.e., resulting from leapfrog development, were generally predicted to have the highest predicted fire risk to the largest proportion of structures in the study area, and infill development was predicted to have the lowest risk. These results suggest that land use planning should be considered an important component to fire risk management and that consistently applied policies based on residential pattern may provide substantial benefits for future risk reduction.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70124275</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moreno, José M.</author><author>Torres, Iván</author><author>Luna, Belén</author><author>Oechel, Walter C.</author><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Changes in fire intensity have carry-over effects on plant responses after the next fire in southern California chaparral</title><secondary-title>Journal of Vegetation Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Vegetation Science</full-title></periodical><pages>395-404</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire regime</keyword><keyword>Fire severity</keyword><keyword>Fire season</keyword><keyword>Adenostoma</keyword><keyword>Ceanothus</keyword><keyword>Fire cycle</keyword><keyword>Post-fire recruitment</keyword><keyword>Seeder</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1654-1103</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1654-1103.2012.01466.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Question Do variations in fire intensity within a stand determine changes in fire intensity and plant demographics in a subsequent fire? Location San Diego (CA, USA); chaparral dominated by Adenostoma fasciculatum (resprouter) and Ceanothus greggii (seeder). Methods In 2003, a wildfire burned a young (16-yr-old) stand containing a set of experimental plots burned in 1987 with various levels of fire intensity. In 2004, all the 1987 plots were sampled for Adenostoma survival and the recruitment of both species. Similar measures were carried out in the adjacent old (75-yr) stand. Fire intensity in 2003 was estimated by a surrogate fire severity measure [minimum diameter of burned branches (branch diameter)]. Results In the young stand, branch diameter in 2003 was similar to the control plots in 1987, but lower than in the old stand. Fire intensity in 1987 did not significantly affect branch diameter in 2003. Survival of Adenostoma in the young stand was very low, much lower than after the 1987 burn and that in the old stand. Fire intensity in 1987 did not affect Adenostoma survival. Recruitment in Adenostoma increased, and in Ceanothus decreased, with increased fire intensity in 1987. Conclusions We demonstrate that there is a carry-over effect of fire intensity across a whole fire cycle on plant recruitment of the two dominant species. The 2003 fire partially reversed the relative effects on recruitment caused by elevated fire intensity in 1987. Arguably, this effect was driven by the contrasted relationships of the two species to fire intensity. Adenostoma survival in the young stand was much lower in 2003 than in 1987, despite similar branch diameter, and was also lower than in the old stand, despite higher branch diameter in this case. The causes of such mortality are unknown.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70179085</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nelson, Kurtis J.</author><author>Connot, Joel</author><author>Peterson, Birgit</author><author>Martin, Charley</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The LANDFIRE refresh Strategy: Updating the National dataset</title><secondary-title>Fire Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Fire Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>80-101</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>LANDFIRE</keyword><keyword>Remote sensing</keyword><keyword>Change detection</keyword><keyword>Fire behavior modeling</keyword><keyword>Fuel mapping</keyword><keyword>MIICA</keyword><keyword>Refresh</keyword><keyword>VCT</keyword><keyword>Vegetation transition</keyword><keyword>Wallow fire</keyword><keyword>_Invalid DOI</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1933-9747</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.4996/fireecology.090280</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The LANDFIRE Program provides comprehensive vegetation and fuel datasets for the entire United States. As with many large-scale ecological datasets, vegetation and landscape conditions must be updated periodically to account for disturbances, growth, and natural succession. The LANDFIRE Refresh effort was the first attempt to consistently update these products nationwide. It incorporated a combination of specific systematic improvements to the original LANDFIRE National data, remote sensing based disturbance detection methods, field collected disturbance information, vegetation growth and succession modeling, and vegetation transition processes. This resulted in the creation of two complete datasets for all 50 states: LANDFIRE Refresh 2001, which includes the systematic improvements, and LANDFIRE Refresh 2008, which includes the disturbance and succession updates to the vegetation and fuel data. The new datasets are comparable for studying landscape changes in vegetation type and structure over a decadal period, and provide the most recent characterization of fuel conditions across the country. The applicability of the new layers is discussed and the effects of using the new fuel datasets are demonstrated through a fire behavior modeling exercise using the 2011 Wallow Fire in eastern Arizona as an example.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70047430</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yue, C.</author><author>Ciais, P.</author><author>Luyssaert, S.</author><author>Cadule, P.</author><author>Harden, J.</author><author>Randerson, J.</author><author>Bellassen, V.</author><author>Wang, T.</author><author>Piao, S.

They leave a historical legacy of a mosaic landscape of different aged forest cohorts. This forest age dynamics must be included in vegetation models to accurately quantify the role of fire in the historical and current regional forest carbon balance. The present study adapted the global process-based vegetation model ORCHIDEE to simulate the CO2 emissions from boreal forest fire and the subsequent recovery after a stand-replacing fire; the model represents postfire new cohort establishment, forest stand structure and the self-thinning process. Simulation results are evaluated against observations of three clusters of postfire forest chronosequences in Canada and Alaska. The variables evaluated include: fire carbon emissions, CO2 fluxes (gross primary production, total ecosystem respiration and net ecosystem exchange), leaf area index, and biometric measurements (aboveground biomass carbon, forest floor carbon, woody debris carbon, stand individual density, stand basal area, and mean diameter at breast height). When forced by local climate and the atmospheric CO2 history at each chronosequence site, the model simulations generally match the observed CO2 fluxes and carbon stock data well, with model-measurement mean square root of deviation comparable with the measurement accuracy (for CO2 flux ∼100 g C m-2 yr-1, for biomass carbon ∼1000 g C m-2 and for soil carbon ∼2000 g C m−2). We find that the current postfire forest carbon sink at the evaluation sites, as observed by chronosequence methods, is mainly due to a combination of historical CO2 increase and forest succession. Climate change and variability during this period offsets some of these expected carbon gains. The negative impacts of climate were a likely consequence of increasing water stress caused by significant temperature increases that were not matched by concurrent increases in precipitation. Our simulation results demonstrate that a global vegetation model such as ORCHIDEE is able to capture the essential ecosystem processes in fire-disturbed boreal forests and produces satisfactory results in terms of both carbon fluxes and carbon-stock evolution after fire. This makes the model suitable for regional simulations in boreal regions where fire regimes play a key role in the ecosystem carbon balance. © Author(s) 2013.

We studied this relationship across 69.2km2of Yosemite National Park, USA, that was subject to 32 fires ≥40ha between 1984 and 2010. Forests types included ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), white fir-sugar pine (Abies concolor/Pinus lambertiana), and red fir (Abies magnifica). We estimated and stratified burned area by fire severity using the Landsat-derived Relativized differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR). Airborne LiDAR data, acquired in July 2010, measured the vertical and horizontal structure of canopy material and landscape patterning of canopy patches and gaps. Increasing fire severity changed structure at the scale of fire severity patches, the arrangement of canopy patches and gaps within fire severity patches, and vertically within tree clumps. Each forest type showed an individual trajectory of structural change with increasing fire severity. As a result, the relationship between estimates of fire severity such as RdNBR and actual changes appears to vary among forest types. We found three arrangements of canopy patches and gaps associated with different fire severities: canopy-gap arrangements in which gaps were enclosed in otherwise continuous canopy (typically unburned and low fire severities); patch-gap arrangements in which tree clumps and gaps alternated and neither dominated (typically moderate fire severity); and open-patch arrangements in which trees were scattered across open areas (typically high fire severity).Compared to stands outside fire perimeters, increasing fire severity generally resulted first in loss of canopy cover in lower height strata and increased number and size of gaps, then in loss of canopy cover in higher height strata, and eventually the transition to open areas with few or no trees. However, the estimated fire severities at which these transitions occurred differed for each forest type. Our work suggests that low severity fire in red fir forests and moderate severity fire in ponderosa pine and white fir-sugar pine forests would restore vertical and horizontal canopy structures believed to have been common prior to the start of widespread fire suppression in the early 1900s. The fusion of LiDAR and Landsat data identified post-fire structural conditions that would not be identified by Landsat alone, suggesting a broad applicability of combining Landsat and LiDAR data for landscape-scale structural analysis for fire management. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70123898</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pastick, Neal J.</author><author>Jorgenson, M.

This method of extrapolation (r = 0.86) used subsurface resistivity, Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) at-sensor reflectance, thermal, TM-derived spectral indices, digital elevation models and other relevant spatial data to estimate near-surface (0–2.6-m depth) resistivity at 30-m resolution. A piecewise regression model (r = 0.82) and a presence/absence decision tree classification (accuracy of 87%) were used to estimate active-layer thickness (ALT) (&lt; 101 cm) and the probability of near-surface (up to 123-cm depth) permafrost occurrence from field data, modelled near-surface (0–2.6 m) resistivity, and other relevant remote sensing and map data. At site scale, the predicted ALTs were similar to those previously observed for different vegetation types. At the landscape scale, the predicted ALTs tended to be thinner on higher-elevation loess deposits than on low-lying alluvial and sand sheet deposits of the Yukon Flats. The ALT and permafrost maps provide a baseline for future permafrost monitoring, serve as inputs for modelling hydrological and carbon cycles at local to regional scales, and offer insight into the ALT response to fire and thaw processes.

To assess the effects of fire on surface topography, soil roughness, and vegetation, we used terrestrial (ground-based) LiDAR to quantify the differences between burned and unburned surfaces by creating a series of high-resolution vegetation structure and bare-earth surface models for six sample plots in the Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument, Arizona. We find that 11 years following prescribed burns, mound volumes, plant heights, and soil-surface roughness were significantly lower on burned relative to unburned plots. Results also suggest a linkage between vegetation and soil mounds, either through accretion or erosion mechanisms such as wind and/or water erosion. The biogeomorphic implications of fire-induced changes are significant. Reduced plant cover and altered soil surfaces from fire likely influence seed residence times, inhibit seed germination and plant establishment, and affect other ecohydrological processes.

The burn area covers all or part of six watersheds and selected basins draining to the Big Wood River and is at risk of substantial post-fire erosion, such as that caused by debris flows. Empirical models derived from statistical evaluation of data collected from recently burned basins throughout the Intermountain Region in Western United States were used to estimate the probability of debris-flow occurrence, potential volume of debris flows, and the combined debris-flow hazard ranking along the drainage network within the burn area and to estimate the same for analyzed drainage basins within the burn area. Input data for the empirical models included topographic parameters, soil characteristics, burn severity, and rainfall totals and intensities for a (1) 2-year-recurrence, 1-hour-duration rainfall, referred to as a 2- year storm (13 mm); (2) 10-year-recurrence, 1-hour-duration rainfall, referred to as a 10-year storm (19 mm); and (3) 25-year-recurrence, 1-hour-duration rainfall, referred to as a 25-year storm (22 mm). Estimated debris-flow probabilities for drainage basins upstream of 130 selected basin outlets ranged from less than 1 to 78 percent with the probabilities increasing with each increase in storm magnitude. Probabilities were high in three of the six watersheds. For the 25-year storm, probabilities were greater than 60 percent for 11 basin outlets and ranged from 50 to 60 percent for an additional 12 basin outlets. Probability estimates for stream segments within the drainage network can vary within a basin. For the 25-year storm, probabilities for stream segments within 33 basins were higher than the basin outlet, emphasizing the importance of evaluating the drainage network as well as basin outlets. Estimated debris-flow volumes for the three modeled storms range from a minimal debris flow volume of 10 cubic meters [m3]) to greater than 100,000 m3. Estimated debris-flow volumes increased with basin size and distance downstream. For the 25-year storm, estimated debris-flow volumes were greater than 100,000 m³ for 4 basins and between 50,000 and 100,000 m³ for 10 basins. The debris-flow hazard rankings did not result in the highest hazard ranking of 5, indicating that none of the basins had a high probability of debris-flow occurrence and a high debris-flow volume estimate. The hazard ranking was 4 for one basin using the 10-year-recurrence storm model and for three basins using the 25-year- recurrence storm model. The maps presented herein may be used to prioritize areas where post-wildfire remediation efforts should take place within the 2- to 3-year period of increased erosional vulnerability.</abstract><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2013/1273/pdfs/ofr2013-1273.pdf</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schuur, E.

The overall amount, rate, and form of C released to the atmosphere in a warmer world will influence the strength of the permafrost C feedback to climate change.We used a survey to quantify variability in the perception of the vulnerability of permafrostCto climate change. Expertswere asked to provide quantitative estimates of permafrost change in response to four scenarios of warming. For the highest warming scenario (RCP 8.5), experts hypothesized that C release frompermafrost zone soils could be 19–45 Pg C by 2040, 162–288 Pg C by 2100, and 381–616 Pg C by 2300 in CO2 equivalent using 100-year CH4 global warming potential (GWP). These values become 50 % larger using 20-year CH4GWP, with a third to a half of expected climate forcing coming from CH4 even though CH4 was only 2.3 % of the expected C release. Experts projected that two- thirds of this release could be avoided under the lowest warming scenario (RCP 2.6). These results highlight the potential risk from permafrost thaw and serve to frame a hypothesis about the magnitude of this feedback to climate change. However, the level of emissions proposed here are unlikely to overshadow the impact of fossil fuel burning, which will continue to be the main source of C emissions and climate forcing.

In addition to reducing the risk of high-severity wildfires in unwanted areas, stand thinning may increase wildlife and plant diversity and provide increased opportunity for seedling recruitment. We initiated conservative (i.e. minimal removal of trees) ponderosa stand thinning treatments with the goals of reducing fire risk and improving habitat conditions for native wildlife and flora. We then compared site occupancy of brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), chipping sparrows (Spizella passerina), plumbeous vireos (Vireo plumbeus), and western wood-pewees (Contopus sordidulus) in thinned and unthinned (i.e., control) forest stands from 2007 to 2009. Survey stations located in thinned stands had 64% fewer trees/ha, 25% less canopy cover, and 23% less basal area than stations in control stands. Occupancy by all three host species was negatively associated with tree density, suggesting that these species respond favorably to forest thinning treatments in ponderosa pine forests. We also encountered plumbeous vireos more frequently in plots closer to an ecotonal (forest/grassland) edge, an association that may increase their susceptibility to edge-specialist, brood parasites like brown-headed cowbirds. Occupancy of brown-headed cowbirds was not related to forest metrics but was related to occupancy by plumbeous vireos and the other host species in aggregate, supporting previous reports on the affiliation between these species. Forest management practices that promote heterogeneity in forest stand structure may benefit songbird populations in our area, but these treatments may also confer costs associated with increased cowbird occupancy. Further research is required to understand more on the complex relationships between occupancy of cowbirds and host species, and between cowbird occupancy and realized rates of nest parasitism. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70157210</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Leicht-Young, Stacey A.</author><author>Pavlovic, Noel B.</author><author>Grundel, Ralph</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Susceptibility of eastern US habitats to invasion of Celastrus orbiculatus (oriental bittersweet) following fire</title><secondary-title>Forest Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forest Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>85-96</pages><volume>302</volume><keywords><keyword>Invasive species</keyword><keyword>Celastrus orbiculatus</keyword><keyword>Establishment</keyword><keyword>Germination</keyword><keyword>Litter removal</keyword><keyword>Post-burn environment</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1219926833</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.foreco.2013.03.019</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fire effects on invasive species are an important land management issue in areas subjected to prescribed fires as well as wildfires. These effects on invasive species can be manifested across life stages. The liana Celastrus orbiculatus (oriental bittersweet) is a widespread invader of eastern US habitats including those where fire management is in practice. This study examined if prescribed fire makes these habitats more susceptible to invasion of C. orbiculatus by seed at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Four treatments (control, litter removed, high and low intensity fire) were applied in six habitat types (sand savanna/woodland, sand prairie, moraine prairie, sand oak forest, beech-maple forest, and oak-hickory forest) and germinating seedlings were tracked over two growing seasons. Treatment did not have a significant effect on the germination, survival, or biomass of C. orbiculatus. However, habitat type did influence these responses mostly in the first growing season. Moraine prairie, beech-maple forest, and oak-hickory forests had the greatest peak percentage of germinants. Moraine prairie had significantly greater survival than oak forest and savanna habitats. Control plots with intact litter, and the moraine prairie habitat had the tallest seedlings at germination, while tallest final heights and greatest aboveground biomass were highest in oak forest. Thus, fire and litter removal did not increase the susceptibility of these habitats to germination and survival of C. orbiculatus. These results indicate that most eastern US habitats are vulnerable to invasion by this species via seed regardless of the level or type of disturbance to the litter layer. ?? 2013.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70047222</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stevens, Michael R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analysis of postfire hydrology, water quality, and sediment transport for selected streams in areas of the 2002 Hayman and Hinman fires, Colorado</title></titles><pages>106-106</pages><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2012-5267</isbn><abstract>Comparison of measured concentrations to applicable water- quality standards also are discussed. Postfire hydrologic effects were exemplified by a damaging flood in the Hayman burn area that occurred on July 2006 after 2.2 in. of rain, which increased the flow in West Creek from 62 cubic feet per second (ft3 /s) to 2,170 ft3 /s in about 45 min, causing approximately $11 million in damage to Colorado State Highway 67. In the Hinman burn area, despite a snow-water equivalent that was near the 1999 through 2009 average, high runoff and local flooding were produced in 2003 in the burned North Fork Elk River (snowmelt peak measured 1,180 ft3 /s) and Lost Dog Creek (snowmelt peak measured 174 ft3 /s) watersheds, which were about 50 percent and 38 percent larger, respectively, than the estimated 100-year recurrence flood. Peak streamflow data for the postburn 2003 period indicated that a smaller amount of snow-water equivalent produced about a 30 percent increase in the annual peak streamflow than was predicted by the relation of peakflow and snow-water equivalent for the available prefire years (1999–2002). Streamflow and transport of water-quality constituents were substantially higher in the immediate (the first year after the fire) postburn conditions and remained higher for 5 years thereafter for the burned Hayman stream (Fourmile Creek) than in the unburned reference stream (Pine Creek). In streams of both the Hayman and Hinman fires, concentrations and loads of almost every water-quality constituent were higher (sometimes by orders of magnitude) in streams receiving postfire runoff than in unburned reference streams. In the Hayman fire study area, dissolved nitrite plus nitrate and orthophosphorus concentrations were generally one order of magnitude or larger in the first year postfire runoff (2003) in a burned watershed (Fourmile Creek), than in stream samples collected from an unburned watershed (Pine Creek). Similarly, total nitrogen and total phosphorus stream concentrations were generally two or three orders of magnitude larger for Fourmile Creek in the first year of postfire runoff (2003) than stream concentrations in unburned Pine Creek. Total organic carbon concentrations (TOC) during storms in Fourmile Creek were large, including a maximum concentration for the May 30, 2003, storm of 4,160 milligrams per liter (mg/L). Median TOC concentrations (2003–2007) in Fourmile Creek (7.1 mg/L) were larger than median concentrations in the unburned Pine Creek watershed (3.1 mg/L). Median dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (2003–2007) in Fourmile Creek (2.7 mg/L) were similar to those in the unburned Pine Creek watershed (3.2 mg/L). DOC concentrations were high in some storm runoff samples from Fourmile Creek, including three storms that had concentrations ranging from 10 mg/L to 30 mg/L in Fourmile Creek. Stream concentrations in the burned Fourmile Creek watershed in the Hayman fire study area were tested using a LOWESS streamflow adjustment and seasonal Kendall trend test. Results indicated that downward trends (percent decrease per year over 5 years) were statistically significant (p-value &lt;0.10) for specific conductance (–7.3), calcium (–11.8), magnesium (–8.82), potassium (–10.9), total ammonia plus organic nitrogen (–26.1), nitrite plus nitrate (–17.4), total phosphorus (–37.5), dissolved phosphorus (–25.6), dissolved organic carbon (–8.9), total recoverable arsenic (–31.0), dissolved copper (–8.8), dissolved manganese (–48.5), total recoverable manganese (–30.5), and total recoverable mercury (–30.6). Suspended-sediment concentrations in samples from the Hayman fire study area ranged from 1 to 83 mg/L in Pine Creek and from 4 to 55,000 mg/L in Fourmile Creek. Comparison of paired instantaneous suspended-sediment concentration and load using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, indicated larger val- ues in the burned watershed (p-value &lt;0.10). Seasonal Kendall trend testing of concentrations (LOWESS-adjusted for stream- flow) and loads (not adjusted) for 5 years postfire (2003–2007) in the Hayman fire study area in the burned Fourmile Creek watershed indicated downward trends (percent decrease per year over 5 years) in suspended-sediment concentration (–47.2) and load (–44.5) that were statistically significant (p-value &lt;0.10), indicating a decrease in suspended-sediment concentration and load during the 5-year period. Comparison of instantaneous nutrient concentrations of prefire and postfire data in the Hinman fire study area, using the Mann-Whitney rank-sum test, indicated postfire concentrations were larger in Lost Dog Creek (p-value &lt;0.10) for total ammonia plus organic nitrogen, and dissolved nitrite, nitrite plus nitrate, ammonia, and total and dissolved phosphorus. Postfire nutrient concentrations during high streamflow were sometimes several times larger than the prefire concentrations. Median DOC and TOC concentrations from Lost Dog Creek and North Fork Elk River were similar (within about 1 mg/L) to concentrations from a local unburned reference stream (Mad Creek). Although higher concentrations of TOC were detected in the burned streams (maximum 35 mg/L) than in the unburned stream (maximum 9.5 mg/L) during high streamflow, April–November. These results may indicate that, in the snowmelt-dominated setting, postfire DOC concentrations may not increase or may be masked by dilution resulting from the increase in postfire streamflow. Suspended-sediment concentrations in samples collected from Lost Dog Creek ranged from less than 1 to 10 mg/L in prefire samples (1999 and 2000) and from 3 to 565 mg/L in postfire samples (2003). Estimated seasonal (April–September) suspended-sediment loads during prefire (1999) and postfire (2003) conditions indicate that suspended-sediment loads (normalized to drainage area) for postfire conditions were about one order of magnitude larger than prefire loads in North Fork Elk River, and more than two orders of magnitude larger than prefire suspended-sediment loads in Lost Dog Creek. Exceedances of Colorado water-quality standards in streams of both the Hayman and Hinman fire study areas only occurred for concentrations of five trace elements (not all trace-element exceedances occurred in every stream). Selected samples analyzed for total recoverable arsenic (fixed), dissolved copper (acute and chronic), total recoverable iron (chronic), dissolved manganese (acute, chronic, and fixed) and total recoverable mercury (chronic) exceeded Colorado aquatic-life standards.</abstract><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20125267</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Peters, D.

Desertification is a cumulative threat that includes both climatic (e.g., drought) and land-use drivers (e.g., livestock overgrazing, fire). In this chapter, we determine the vulnerability of different ecosystem services to changes in drivers and ecosystem states, with a focus on the American Southwest. We have four objectives: (1) to describe key services in drylands, (2) to identify consequences of desertification to each service, (3) to explore the vulnerability of each service to future state-changes if existing threats intensify and new threats emerge, and (4) to determine threats expected to have the greatest future impact, and to provide potential actions for mitigation.

However, little is known about the relationships between Spotted Owl survival and home-range size and the characteristics of fire-prone, mixed-conifer forests of the Klamath province. Thus, the objectives of this study were to estimate monthly survival rates and home-range size in relation to habitat characteristics for Northern Spotted Owls in southwestern Oregon. Home-range size and survival of 15 Northern Spotted Owls was monitored using radiotelemetry in the Ashland Ranger District of the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest from September 2006 to October 2008. Habitat classes within Spotted Owl home ranges were characterized using a remote-sensed vegetation map of the study area. Estimates of monthly survival ranged from 0.89 to 1.0 and were positively correlated with the number of late-seral habitat patches and the amount of edge, and negatively correlated with the mean nearest neighbor distance between late-seral habitats. Annual home-range size varied from to 189 to 894 ha ((x) over bar = 576; SE = 75), with little difference between breeding and nonbreeding home ranges. Breeding-season home-range size increased with the amount of hard edge, and the amount of old and mature forest combined. Core area, annual and nonbreeding season home-range sizes all increased with increased amounts of hard edge, suggesting that increased fragmentation is associated with larger core and home-range sizes. Although no effect of the amount of late-seral stage forest on either survival or home-range size was detected, these results are the first to concurrently demonstrate increased forest fragmentation with decreased survival and increased home-range size of Northern Spotted Owls.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.3356/JRR-11-76.1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hawbaker, Todd J</author><author>Briggs, Jennifer S</author><author>Caldwell, Megan K</author><author>Stitt, Susan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mountain pine beetle impacts on vegetation and carbon stocks</title></titles><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2013-3095</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/fs20133095</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Richardson, Leslie</author><author>Loomis, John B</author><author>Champ, Patricia a</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Valuing Morbidity from Wildfire Smoke Exposure: A Comparison of Revealed and Stated Preference Techniques.</title><secondary-title>Land Economics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Land Economics</full-title></periodical><pages>76-100</pages><volume>89</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>AIR pollution</keyword><keyword>CALIFORNIA</keyword><keyword>CONTINGENT valuation</keyword><keyword>ECONOMIC aspects</keyword><keyword>ENVIRONMENTAL policy</keyword><keyword>ENVIRONMENTAL quality -- Economic aspects</keyword><keyword>REVEALED preference theory</keyword><keyword>SMOKE</keyword><keyword>STATED preference methods</keyword><keyword>WILDFIRES -- California</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Estimating the economic benefits of reduced health damages due to improvements in environmental quality continues to challenge economists. We review welfare measures associated with reduced wildfire smoke exposure, and a unique dataset from California's Station Fire of 2009 allows for a comparison of cost of illness (CO1) estimates with willingness to pay (WTP) measures. The WTP for one less symptom day is estimated to be $87 and $95, using the defensive behavior and contingent valuation methods, respectively. These WTP estimates are not statistically different but do differ from a $3 traditional daily CO1 estimate and $17 comprehensive daily CO1 estimate.

Nocturnal call-playback surveys for Yellow Rails were conducted over 3 years at Seney National Wildlife Refuge in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Effects of habitat structure and landscape variables on the probability of use by Yellow Rails were assessed at two scales, representing a range of home range sizes, using generalized linear mixed models. Habitat differences relative to fire history and comparisons between sites with and without Yellow Rails indicated that Yellow Rails used areas with the deepest litter and highest ground cover, and relatively low shrub cover and heights, as well as landscapes having greater sedge-grass cover and less lowland woody or upland cover types. Burning every 2-5 years appears to provide the litter, ground-level cover, and woody conditions attractive to Yellow Rails.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1675/063.036.0209</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huang, Shengli</author><author>Jin, Suming</author><author>Dahal, Devendra</author><author>Chen, Xuexia</author><author>Young, Claudia</author><author>Liu, Heping</author><author>Liu, Shuguang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reconstructing satellite images to quantify spatially explicit land surface change caused by fires and succession: A demonstration in the Yukon River Basin of interior Alaska</title><secondary-title>ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing</full-title></periodical><pages>94-105</pages><volume>79</volume><keywords><keyword>Fire</keyword><keyword>Landsat</keyword><keyword>Alaska</keyword><keyword>Image reconstruction</keyword><keyword>Land surface</keyword><keyword>NDVI</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0924-2716</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2013.02.010</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Land surface change caused by fires and succession is confounded by many site-specific factors and requires further study. The objective of this study was to reveal the spatially explicit land surface change by minimizing the confounding factors of weather variability, seasonal offset, topography, land cover, and drainage. In a pilot study of the Yukon River Basin of interior Alaska, we retrieved Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), albedo, and land surface temperature (LST) from a postfire Landsat image acquired on August 5th, 2004. With a Landsat reference image acquired on June 26th, 1986, we reconstructed NDVI, albedo, and LST of 1987-2004 fire scars for August 5th, 2004, assuming that these fires had not occurred. The difference between actual postfire and assuming-no-fire scenarios depicted the fires and succession impact. Our results demonstrated the following: (1) NDVI showed an immediate decrease after burning but gradually recovered to prefire levels in the following years, in which burn severity might play an important role during this process; (2) Albedo showed an immediate decrease after burning but then recovered and became higher than prefire levels; and (3) Most fires caused surface warming, but cooler surfaces did exist; time-since-fire affected the prefire and postfire LST difference but no absolute trend could be found. Our approach provided spatially explicit land surface change rather than average condition, enabling a better understanding of fires and succession impact on ecological consequences at the pixel level. © 2013.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70188334</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moritz, Max A</author><author>Krawchuk, Meg A</author><author>Keeley, Jon E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Curren fire regimes, impacts annd the likely changes: Temperate-Mediterranean North America</title></titles><pages>143-152</pages><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>VIII</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70157100</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Mantgem, Phillip J.</author><author>Nesmith, Jonathan C.B.</author><author>Keifer, Marybeth</author><author>Knapp, Eric E.</author><author>Flint, Alan</author><author>Flint, Lorriane</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Climatic stress increases forest fire severity across the western United States</title><secondary-title>Ecology Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecology Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>1151-1156</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire effects</keyword><keyword>Prescribed fire</keyword><keyword>Climate</keyword><keyword>Tree mortality</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1461-0248</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/ele.12151</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Pervasive warming can lead to chronic stress on forest trees, which may contribute to mortality resulting from fire-caused injuries. Longitudinal analyses of forest plots from across the western US show that high pre-fire climatic water deficit was related to increased post-fire tree mortality probabilities. This relationship between climate and fire was present after accounting for fire defences and injuries, and appeared to influence the effects of crown and stem injuries. Climate and fire interactions did not vary substantially across geographical regions, major genera and tree sizes. Our findings support recent physiological evidence showing that both drought and heating from fire can impair xylem conductivity. Warming trends have been linked to increasing probabilities of severe fire weather and fire spread; our results suggest that warming may also increase forest fire severity (the number of trees killed) independent of fire intensity (the amount of heat released during a fire).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70047235</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Glenn, Edward P.</author><author>Mexicano, Lourdes</author><author>Garcia-Hernandez, Jaqueline</author><author>Nagler, Pamela L.</author><author>Gomez-Sapiens, Martha M.</author><author>Tang, Dawei</author><author>Lomeli, Marcelo A.</author><author>Ramirez-Hernandez, Jorge</author><author>Zamora-Arroyo, Francisco</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evapotranspiration and water balance of an anthropogenic coastal desert wetland: Responses to fire, inflows and salinities</title><secondary-title>Ecological Engineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Engineering</full-title></periodical><pages>176-184</pages><volume>59</volume><keywords><keyword>Remote sensing</keyword><keyword>MODIS</keyword><keyword>Cattail</keyword><keyword>Colorado River delta</keyword><keyword>Common reed</keyword><keyword>Salinity</keyword><keyword>Wetland water budget</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0925-8574</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ecoleng.2012.06.043</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Evapotranspiration (ET) and other water balance components were estimated for Cienega de Santa Clara, an anthropogenic brackish wetland in the delta of the Colorado River in Mexico. The marsh is in the Biosphere Reserve of the Upper Gulf of California and Delta of the Colorado River, and supports a high abundance and diversity of wildlife. Over 95% of its water supply originates as agricultural drain water from the USA, sent for disposal in Mexico. This study was conducted from 2009 to 2011, before, during and after a trial run of the Yuma Desalting Plant in the USA, which will divert water from the wetland and replace it with brine from the desalting operation. The goal was to estimate the main components in the water budget to be used in creating management scenarios for this marsh. We used a remote sensing algorithm to estimate ET from meteorological data and Enhanced Vegetation Index values from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) sensors on the Terra satellite. ET estimates from the MODIS method were then compared to results from a mass balance of water and salt inflows and outflows over the study period. By both methods, mean annual ET estimates ranged from 2.6 to 3.0mmd-1, or 50 to 60% of reference ET (ETo). Water entered at a mean salinity of 2.6gL-1 TDS and mean salinity in the wetland was 3.73gL-1 TDS over the 33 month study period. Over an annual cycle, 54% of inflows supported ET while the rest exited the marsh as outflows; however, in winter when ET was low, up to 90% of the inflows exited the marsh. An analysis of ET estimates over the years 2000-2011 showed that annual ET was proportional to the volume of inflows, but was also markedly stimulated by fires. Spring fires in 2006 and 2011 burned off accumulated thatch, resulting in vigorous growth of new leaves and a 30% increase in peak summer ET compared to non-fire years. Following fires, peak summer ET estimates were equal to ETo, while in non-fire years peak ET was equal to only one-half to two-thirds of ETo. Over annual cycles, estimated ET was always lower than ETo, because T. domingensis is dormant in winter and shades the water surface, reducing direct evaporation. Thus, ET of a Typha marsh is likely to be less than an open water surface under most conditions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70043750</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yager, Tracy J B</author><author>Crock, James G</author><author>Smith, David B</author><author>Furlong, Edward T</author><author>Hageman, Philip L</author><author>Foreman, William T</author><author>Gray, James L</author><author>ReVello, Rhiannon C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of surface applications of biosolids on groundwater quality and trace-element concentrations in crops near Deer Trail, Colorado, 2004-2010</title></titles><pages>129-129</pages><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2013-5065</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20135065</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Clark, Gregory M</author><author>Fosness, Ryan L</author><author>Wood, Molly S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sediment transport in the lower Snake and Clearwater River Basins, Idaho and Washington, 2008–11</title></titles><pages>66-66</pages><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2013-5083</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20135083</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>López-Hoffman, Laura</author><author>Breshears, David D.</author><author>Allen, Craig D.</author><author>Miller, Marc L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Key landscape ecology metrics for assessing climate change adaptation options: Rate of change and patchiness of impacts</title><secondary-title>Ecosphere</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecosphere</full-title></periodical><volume>4</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Ecosystem services</keyword><keyword>Forest die-off</keyword><keyword>Colorado River delta</keyword><keyword>Climate change adaptation</keyword><keyword>Piñon-juniper woodlands</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2150-8925</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1890/ES13-00118.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Under a changing climate, devising strategies to help stakeholders adapt to alterations to ecosystems and their services is of utmost importance. In western North America, diminished snowpack and river flows are causing relatively gradual, homogeneous (system-wide) changes in ecosystems and services. In addition, increased climate variability is also accelerating the incidence of abrupt and patchy disturbances such as fires, floods and droughts. This paper posits that two key variables often considered in landscape ecology—the rate of change and the degree of patchiness of change—can aid in developing climate change adaptation strategies. We use two examples from the “borderland” region of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. In piñon-juniper woodland die-offs that occurred in the southwestern United States during the 2000s, ecosystem services suddenly crashed in some parts of the system while remaining unaffected in other locations. The precise timing and location of die-offs was uncertain. On the other hand, slower, homogeneous change, such as the expected declines in water supply to the Colorado River delta, will likely impact the entire ecosystem, with ecosystem services everywhere in the delta subject to alteration, and all users likely exposed. The rapidity and spatial heterogeneity of faster, patchy climate change exemplified by tree die-off suggests that decision-makers and local stakeholders would be wise to operate under a Rawlsian “veil of ignorance,” and implement adaptation strategies that allow ecosystem service users to equitably share the risk of sudden loss of ecosystem services before actual ecosystem changes occur. On the other hand, in the case of slower, homogeneous, system-wide impacts to ecosystem services as exemplified by the Colorado River delta, adaptation strategies can be implemented after the changes begin, but will require a fundamental rethinking of how ecosystems and services are used and valued. In sum, understanding how the rate of change and degree of patchiness of change will constrain adaptive options is a critical consideration in preparing for climate change.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70095755</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hicke, Jeffrey A.</author><author>Meddens, Arjan J H</author><author>Allen, Craig D.</author><author>Kolden, Crystal A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Carbon stocks of trees killed by bark beetles and wildfire in the western United States</title><secondary-title>Environmental Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>1-8</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>bark beetle outbreaks</keyword><keyword>forest carbon cycling</keyword><keyword>forest disturbances</keyword><keyword>western United States</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1748-9326</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1088/1748-9326/8/3/035032</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Forests are major components of the carbon cycle, and disturbances are important influences of forest carbon. Our objective was to contribute to the understanding of forest carbon cycling by quantifying the amount of carbon in trees killed by two disturbance types, fires and bark beetles, in the western United States in recent decades.We combined existing spatial data sets of forest biomass, burn severity, and beetle-caused tree mortality to estimate the amount of aboveground and belowground carbon in killed trees across the region.We found that during 1984–2010, fires killed trees that contained 5–11 Tg C year−1 and during 1997–2010, beetles killed trees that contained 2–24 Tg C year−1, with more trees killed since 2000 than in earlier periods. Over their periods of record, amounts of carbon in trees killed by fires and by beetle outbreaks were similar, and together these disturbances killed trees representing 9% of the total tree carbon in western forests, a similar amount to harvesting. Fires killed more trees in lower-elevation forest types such as Douglas-fir than higher-elevation forest types, whereas bark beetle outbreaks also killed trees in higher-elevation forest types such as lodgepole pine and Engelmann spruce. Over 15% of the carbon in lodgepole pine and spruce/fir forest types was in trees killed by beetle outbreaks; other forest types had 5–10% of the carbon in killed trees. Our results document the importance of these natural disturbances in the carbon budget of the western United States.

Over the previous eight centuries, regional snowpack variability exhibits strong, decadally persistent north-south (N-S) antiphasing of snowpack anomalies. Contrary to the normal regional antiphasing, two intervals of spatially synchronized snow deficits were identified. Snow deficits shown during the 1930s were synchronized north-south by low cool-season precipitation, with spring warming (February–March) since the 1980s driving the majority of the recent synchronous snow declines, especially across the low to middle elevations. Spring warming strongly influenced low snowpacks in the north after 1958, but not in the south until after 1980. The post-1980, synchronous snow decline reduced snow cover at low to middle elevations by ~20% and partly explains earlier and reduced streamflow and both longer and more active fire seasons. Climatologies of Rocky Mountain snowpack are shown to be seasonally and regionally complex, with Pacific decadal variability positively reinforcing the anthropogenic warming trend.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70045945</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Peters, Emily B.</author><author>Wythers, Kirk R.</author><author>Bradford, John B.</author><author>Reich, Peter B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Influence of Disturbance on Temperate Forest Productivity</title><secondary-title>Ecosystems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecosystems</full-title></periodical><pages>95-110</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>disturbance</keyword><keyword>foliar N</keyword><keyword>Great Lakes</keyword><keyword>N mineralization</keyword><keyword>NPP</keyword><keyword>PnET</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1432-9840</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10021-012-9599-y</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The authors of this study used an ecosystem model (PnET-CN), to examine the effects of disturbance type, intensity, and frequency on net primary production (NPP) across 107 forest stands of differing types and disturbance history from Minnesota and Wisconsin, USA. They evaluated the role of past disturbances on NPP, net N mineralization, foliar N, and leaf area index at these sites by comparing model simulations with observations. The model reasonably predicted differences among forest types in productivity, foliar N, leaf area index, and net N mineralization. Modeled NPP was more sensitive to the intensity of soil removal during a disturbance than the fraction of stand mortality or wood removal. Increasing crown fire frequency resulted in lower NPP, particularly for conifer forest types with longer leaf life spans and longer recovery times. The results of this study suggest that moderate frequency disturbances are a relatively less important control on productivity over long time periods than the role of climate, soil, and species traits.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70046795</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wagenbrenner, Natalie S.</author><author>Germino, Matthew J.</author><author>Lamb, Brian K.</author><author>Robichaud, Peter R.</author><author>Foltz, Randy B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Wind erosion from a sagebrush steppe burned by wildfire: Measurements of PM10 and total horizontal sediment flux</title><secondary-title>Aeolian Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Aeolian Research</full-title></periodical><pages>25-36</pages><volume>10</volume><keywords><keyword>Post-fire</keyword><keyword>Dust</keyword><keyword>Wind erosion</keyword><keyword>Horizontal sediment flux</keyword><keyword>PM10</keyword><keyword>Vertical flux</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1875-9637</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.aeolia.2012.10.003</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Wind erosion and aeolian transport processes are under studied compared to rainfall-induced erosion and sediment transport on burned landscapes. Post-fire wind erosion studies have predominantly focused on near-surface sediment transport and associated impacts such as on-site soil loss and site fertility. Downwind impacts, including air quality degradation and deposition of dust or contaminants, are also likely post-fire effects; however, quantitative field measurements of post-fire dust emissions are needed for assessment of these downwind risks. A wind erosion monitoring system was installed immediately following a desert sagebrush and grass wildfire in southeastern Idaho, USA to measure wind erosion from the burned landscape. This paper presents measurements of horizontal sediment flux and PM10 vertical flux from the burned area. We determined threshold wind speeds and corresponding threshold friction velocities to be 6.0 and 0.20ms-1, respectively, for the 4months immediately following the fire and 10 and 0.55ms-1 for the following spring months. Several major wind erosion events were measured in the months following the July 2010 Jefferson Fire. The largest wind erosion event occurred in early September 2010 and produced 1495kgm-1 of horizontal sediment transport within the first 2m above the soil surface, had a maximum PM10 vertical flux of 100mgm-2s-1, and generated a large dust plume that was visible in satellite imagery. The peak PM10 concentration measured on-site at a height of 2m in the downwind portion of the burned area was 690mgm-3. Our results indicate that wildfire can convert a relatively stable landscape into one that is a major dust source. © 2012.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70047347</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Boves, Than J.</author><author>Buehler, David A.</author><author>Sheehan, James</author><author>Wood, Petra Bohall</author><author>Rodewald, Amanda D.</author><author>Larkin, Jeffrey L.</author><author>Keyser, Patrick D.</author><author>Newell, Felicity L.</author><author>George, Gregory A.</author><author>Bakermans, Marja H.</author><author>Evans, Andrea</author><author>Beachy, Tiffany A.</author><author>McDermott, Molly E.</author><author>Perkins, Kelly A.</author><author>White, Matthew</author><author>Wigley, T.

These declines may be in part related to contemporary reductions in small-scale forest interior disturbances such as fire, windthrow, and treefalls. To mitigate the negative impacts of disturbance alteration and suppression on some late-successional species, strategies that emulate natural disturbance regimes are often advocated, but large-scale evaluations of these practices are rare. Here, we assessed the consequences of experimental disturbance (using partial timber harvest) on a severely declining late-successional species, the cerulean warbler (Setophaga cerulea), across the core of its breeding range in the Appalachian Mountains. We measured numerical (density), physiological (body condition), and demographic (age structure and reproduction) responses to three levels of disturbance and explored the potential impacts of disturbance on source-sink dynamics. Breeding densities of warblers increased one to four years after all canopy disturbances (vs. controls) and males occupying territories on treatment plots were in better condition than those on control plots. However, these beneficial effects of disturbance did not correspond to improvements in reproduction; nest success was lower on all treatment plots than on control plots in the southern region and marginally lower on light disturbance plots in the northern region. Our data suggest that only habitats in the southern region acted as sources, and interior disturbances in this region have the potential to create ecological traps at a local scale, but sources when viewed at broader scales. Thus, cerulean warblers would likely benefit from management that strikes a landscape-level balance between emulating natural disturbances in order to attract individuals into areas where current structure is inappropriate, and limiting anthropogenic disturbance in forests that already possess appropriate structural attributes in order to maintain maximum productivity.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70171458</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rigge, Matthew</author><author>Wylie, Bruce</author><author>Gu, Yingxin</author><author>Belnap, Jayne</author><author>Phuyal, Khem</author><author>Tieszen, Larry</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Monitoring the status of forests and rangelands in the Western United States using ecosystem performance anomalies</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Remote Sensing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Remote Sensing</full-title></periodical><pages>4049-4068</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>11</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>11</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/01431161.2013.772311</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The effects of land management and disturbance on ecosystem performance\n(i.e. biomass production) are often confounded by those of weather and\nsite potential. The current study overcomes this issue by calculating\nthe difference between actual and expected ecosystem performance (EEP)\nto generate ecosystem performance anomalies (EPA). This study aims to\ndelineate and quantify average EPA from 20002009 within the Greater\nPlatte and Upper Colorado River Basins, USA. Moderate Resolution Imaging\nSpectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)\nimages averaged over the growing season (GSN) served as a proxy of\nactual ecosystem performance. Yearly EEP was determined with rule-based\npiecewise regression tree models of abiotic data (climate, soils,\nelevation, etc.), independently created for each land cover. EPA were\ncalculated as the residuals of the EEP to GSN relationship, and\ncharacterized as normal performing, underperforming, and overperforming\nat the 90% confidence level. Validation revealed that EPA values were\nrelated to biomass production (R 2=0.56, P=0.02) and likely to the\nproportion of biomass removed by livestock in the Nebraska Sandhills.\nOverall, 60.6% of the study area was (normal) performing near its EEP,\n3.0% was severely underperforming, 5.0% was highly overperforming, and\nthe remainder was slightly underperforming or overperforming. Generally,\ndisturbances such as fires, floods, and insect damage, in addition to\nhigh grazing intensity, result in a negative EPA. Conversely, mature\nstands and appropriate management often result in positive EPA values.\nThis method provides information critical to land managers to evaluate\nthe appropriateness of previous management practices and restoration\nefforts and quantify disturbance impacts. Results are at a scale\nsufficient for many of the large management units of the region and for\nlocating areas needing further investigation. Applications of EPA data\nto monitoring invasive species, grazing impacts, and vulnerability to\nplant community shifts have been suggested by land management\nprofessionals.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70048536</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jafarov, E.

Fire that burns the organic layer can trigger dramatic changes in the underlying permafrost, leading to accelerated ground thawing within a relatively short time. In this study, we addressed the following questions. (1) Which factors determine post-fire ground temperature dynamics in lowland and upland black spruce forests? (2) What levels of burn severity will cause irreversible permafrost degradation in these ecosystems?We evaluated these questions in a transient modeling–sensitivity analysis framework to assess the sensitivity of permafrost to climate, burn severity, soil organic layer thickness, and soil moisture content in lowland (with thick organic layers, ∼80 cm) and upland (with thin organic layers, ∼30 cm) black spruce ecosystems. The results indicate that climate warming accompanied by fire disturbance could significantly accelerate permafrost degradation. In upland black spruce forest, permafrost could completely degrade in an 18 m soil column within 120 years of a severe fire in an unchanging climate. In contrast, in a lowland black spruce forest, permafrost is more resilient to disturbance and can persist under a combination of moderate burn severity and climate warming.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70047756</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Esque, Todd C.</author><author>Webb, Robert H.</author><author>Wallace, Cynthia S.

Fuels were predominantly the native forb Plantago ovata. Large fires at low elevations were rare in the 19th and 20th centuries, and fires fueled by native vegetation are undocumented in the southwestern deserts. We estimated the area damaged by fire using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, which are more accurate and reduce subjectivity of aerial surveys of perimeters of fires. Assemblages of upland and xeroriparian plants lost 91 and 81% of live cover, respectively, in fires. The trees Olneya tesota and Cercidium had high amounts of top-kill. King Valley was an important xeroriparian corridor for birds. Species richness of birds decreased significantly following the fire. Numbers of breeding birds were lower in burned areas of King Valley 3 years post-fire, compared to numbers in nearby but unburned Alamo Wash. Although birds function within a large geographic scale, the extent of this burn still influenced the relative abundance of local species of breeding birds. This suggests that breeding birds respond to conditions of localized burns and slow recovery of vegetation contributes to continued lower numbers of birds in the burned sites in King Valley.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1894/0038-4909-58.2.223</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Frid, Leonardo</author><author>Holcombe, Tracy</author><author>Morisette, Jeffrey T.</author><author>Olsson, Aaryn D.</author><author>Brigham, Lindy</author><author>Bean, Travis M.</author><author>Betancourt, Julio L.</author><author>Bryan, Katherine</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using State-and-Transition Modeling to Account for Imperfect Detection in Invasive Species Management</title><secondary-title>Invasive Plant Science and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Invasive Plant Science and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>36-47</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>01</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1939-7291</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1614/IPSM-D-11-00065.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Buffelgrass, a highly competitive and flammable African bunchgrass, is spreading rapidly across both urban and natural areas in the Sonoran Desert of southern and central Arizona. Damages include increased fire risk, losses in biodiversity, and diminished revenues and quality of life. Feasibility of sustained and successful mitigation will depend heavily on rates of spread, treatment capacity, and cost–benefit analysis. We created a decision support model for the wildland–urban interface north of Tucson, AZ, using a spatial state-and-transition simulation modeling framework, the Tool for Exploratory Landscape Scenario Analyses. We addressed the issues of undetected invasions, identifying potentially suitable habitat and calibrating spread rates, while answering questions about how to allocate resources among inventory, treatment, and maintenance. Inputs to the model include a state-and-transition simulation model to describe the succession and control of buffelgrass, a habitat suitability model, management planning zones, spread vectors, estimated dispersal kernels for buffelgrass, and maps of current distribution. Our spatial simulations showed that without treatment, buffelgrass infestations that started with as little as 80 ha (198 ac) could grow to more than 6,000 ha by the year 2060. In contrast, applying unlimited management resources could limit 2060 infestation levels to approximately 50 ha. The application of sufficient resources toward inventory is important because undetected patches of buffelgrass will tend to grow exponentially. In our simulations, areas affected by buffelgrass may increase substantially over the next 50 yr, but a large, upfront investment in buffelgrass control could reduce the infested area and overall management costs.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S193972910000290X/type/journal_article</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huang, Shengli</author><author>Liu, Heping</author><author>Dahal, Devendra</author><author>Jin, Suming</author><author>Welp, Lisa R.</author><author>Liu, Jinxun</author><author>Liu, Shuguang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeling spatially explicit fire impact on gross primary production in interior Alaska using satellite images coupled with eddy covariance</title><secondary-title>Remote Sensing of Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Remote Sensing of Environment</full-title></periodical><pages>178-188</pages><volume>135</volume><keywords><keyword>Fire</keyword><keyword>Alaska</keyword><keyword>Remote sensing</keyword><keyword>Gross primary production</keyword><keyword>Image reconstruction</keyword><keyword>Eddy covariance</keyword><keyword>Vegetation production</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0034-4257</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.rse.2013.04.003</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In interior Alaska, wildfires change gross primary production (GPP) after the initial disturbance. The impact of fires on GPP is spatially heterogeneous, which is difficult to evaluate by limited point-based comparisons or is insufficient to assess by satellite vegetation index. The direct prefire and postfire comparison is widely used, but the recovery identification may become biased due to interannual climate variability. The objective of this study is to propose a method to quantify the spatially explicit GPP change caused by fires and succession. We collected three Landsat images acquired on 13 July 2004, 5 August 2004, and 6 September 2004 to examine the GPP recovery of burned area from 1987 to 2004. A prefire Landsat image acquired in 1986 was used to reconstruct satellite images assuming that the fires of 1987-2004 had not occurred. We used a light-use efficiency model to estimate the GPP. This model was driven by maximum light-use efficiency (Emax) and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation (FPAR). We applied this model to two scenarios (i.e., an actual postfire scenario and an assuming-no-fire scenario), where the changes in Emaxand FPARwere taken into account. The changes in Emaxwere represented by the change in land cover of evergreen needleleaf forest, deciduous broadleaf forest, and shrub/grass mixed, whose Emaxwas determined from three fire chronosequence flux towers as 1.1556, 1.3336, and 0.5098gC/MJ PAR. The changes in FPARwere inferred from NDVI change between the actual postfire NDVI and the reconstructed NDVI. After GPP quantification for July, August, and September 2004, we calculated the difference between the two scenarios in absolute and percent GPP changes. Our results showed rapid recovery of GPP post-fire with a 24% recovery immediately after burning and 43% one year later. For the fire scars with an age range of 2-17years, the recovery rate ranged from 54% to 95%. In addition to the averaging, our approach further revealed the spatial heterogeneity of fire impact on GPP, allowing one to examine the spatially explicit GPP change caused by fires. © 2013.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70187700</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Caldwell, Colleen A.</author><author>Jacobi, Gerald Z.</author><author>Anderson, Michael C.</author><author>Parmenter, Robert R.</author><author>McGann, Jeanine</author><author>Gould, William R.</author><author>DuBey, Robert</author><author>Jacobi, M.

A late-fall prescribed burn was implemented to characterize effects on an aquatic community within a montane grassland system in north-central New Mexico. The fire treatment was consistent with protocols of a managed burn except that the fire was allowed to burn through the riparian area to the treatment stream to replicate natural fire behavior. In addition to summer and fall preburn assessment of the treatment and reference stream, we characterized immediate postfire effects (within a week for macroinvertebrates and within 6 months for fish) and seasonal effects over a 2-year period. Responses within the treatment stream were compared with an unburned reference stream adjacent to the prescription burn. During the burn, the diel range in air temperature increased by 5 degrees C while diel range in water temperature did not change. Carbon-nitrogen ratios did not differ between treatment and reference streams, indicating the contribution of ash from the surrounding grassland was negligible. Although total taxa and species richness of aquatic macroinvertebrates were not altered, qualitative indices revealed departure from preburn condition due to loss of sensitive taxa (mayflies [order Ephemeroptera] and stoneflies [order Plecoptera]) and an increase in tolerant taxa (midges [order Chironomidae]) following the burn. Within 1 year of the burn, these attributes returned to preburn conditions. The density and recruitment of adult Brown Trout Salmo trutta did not differ between pre- and postburn collections, nor did fish condition differ. Fire is rarely truly replicated within a given study. Although our study represents one replication, the results will inform managers about the importance in timing (seasonality) of prescription burn and anticipated effects on aquatic communities.

It has focused on conservation of ecosystem function through reducing soil erosion and spread of invasive plants. Effectiveness of mitigation treatments has been debated recently. We reviewed recent literature to conduct a meta-analysis of seeding after wildfires to determine if seedings may (1) protect ecosystems against soil erosion and (2) reduce invasion or abundance of undesirable nonnative plant species. Effectiveness of postfire seedings was examined in 8 erosion and 19 invasive species cases. Seeding has little effect on erosion during the first year after fire and is highly dependent upon initial establishment and coverage of species in successive years. Among all seeding cases, 28% reduced, 67% were neutral, and 5% increased invasive species abundance. Older seedings were more likely to show reductions in invasives than younger seedings. Seedings with high plant establishment were more likely to reduce invasives than those with low establishment. Studies are needed that examine (1) frequency of adequate establishment of postfire seedings and causal factors of success or failure, (2) long-term impacts of seeding along a range of initial establishment and concomitant plant coverage over time as it relates to erosion and abundance of invasive plant species, and (3) auxiliary treatments designed to increase likelihood of germination and establishment given the inevitable variability of environmental conditions. These studies would aid land managers in deciding when postfire treatments are required and their likely level of success.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70045388</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Genet, H.</author><author>McGuire, A.

The surface organic horizons insulate the deeper soil from variations in atmospheric temperature. The removal of these insulating horizons through consumption by fire increases the vulnerability of permafrost to thaw, and the carbon stored in permafrost to decomposition. In this study we ask how warming and fire regime may influence spatial and temporal changes in active layer and carbon dynamics across a boreal forest landscape in interior Alaska. To address this question, we (1) developed and tested a predictive model of the effect of fire severity on soil organic horizons that depends on landscape-level conditions and (2) used this model to evaluate the long-term consequences of warming and changes in fire regime on active layer and soil carbon dynamics of black spruce forests across interior Alaska. The predictive model of fire severity, designed from the analysis of field observations, reproduces the effect of local topography (landform category, the slope angle and aspect and flow accumulation), weather conditions (drought index, soil moisture) and fire characteristics (day of year and size of the fire) on the reduction of the organic layer caused by fire. The integration of the fire severity model into an ecosystem process-based model allowed us to document the relative importance and interactions among local topography, fire regime and climate warming on active layer and soil carbon dynamics. Lowlands were more resistant to severe fires and climate warming, showing smaller increases in active layer thickness and soil carbon loss compared to drier flat uplands and slopes. In simulations that included the effects of both warming and fire at the regional scale, fire was primarily responsible for a reduction in organic layer thickness of 0.06 m on average by 2100 that led to an increase in active layer thickness of 1.1 m on average by 2100. The combination of warming and fire led to a simulated cumulative loss of 9.6 kgC m−2 on average by 2100. Our analysis suggests that ecosystem carbon storage in boreal forests in interior Alaska is particularly vulnerable, primarily due to the combustion of organic layer thickness in fire and the related increase in active layer thickness that exposes previously protected permafrost soil carbon to decomposition.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70048541</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Weppner, Kerrie N.</author><author>Pierce, Jennifer L.</author><author>Betancourt, Julio L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Holocene fire occurrence and alluvial responses at the leading edge of pinyon-juniper migration in the Northern Great Basin, USA</title><secondary-title>Quaternary Research (United States)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Quaternary Research (United States)</full-title></periodical><pages>143-157</pages><volume>80</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire</keyword><keyword>Charcoal</keyword><keyword>Holocene</keyword><keyword>Debris flow</keyword><keyword>Idaho</keyword><keyword>Vegetation change</keyword><keyword>Albion Mountains</keyword><keyword>PJ woodlands</keyword><keyword>Woodrat midden</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>00335894</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.yqres.2013.06.004</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fire and vegetation records at the City of Rocks National Reserve (CIRO), south-central Idaho, display the interaction of changing climate, fire and vegetation along the migrating front of single-leaf pinyon (. Pinus monophylla) and Utah juniper (. Juniperus osteosperma). Radiocarbon dating of alluvial charcoal reconstructed local fire occurrence and geomorphic response, and fossil woodrat (. Neotoma) middens revealed pinyon and juniper arrivals. Fire peaks occurred ~. 10,700-9500, 7200-6700, 2400-2000, 850-700, and 550-400. cal. yr. BP, whereas ~. 9500-7200, 6700-4700 and ~. 1500-1000. cal. yr. BP are fire-free. Wetter climates and denser vegetation fueled episodic fires and debris flows during the early and late Holocene, whereas drier climates and reduced vegetation caused frequent sheetflooding during the mid-Holocene. Increased fires during the wetter and more variable late Holocene suggest variable climate and adequate fuels augment fires at CIRO. Utah juniper and single-leaf pinyon colonized CIRO by 3800 and 2800. cal. yr. BP, respectively, though pinyon did not expand broadly until ~. 700. cal. yr. BP. Increased fire-related deposition coincided with regional droughts and pinyon infilling ~. 850-700 and 550-400. cal. yr. BP. Early and late Holocene vegetation change probably played a major role in accelerated fire activity, which may be sustained into the future due to pinyon-juniper densification and cheatgrass invasion. © 2013 University of Washington.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70186189</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Muhs, Daniel R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The contributions of Donald Lee Johnson to understanding the Quaternary geologic and biogeographic history of the California Channel Islands</title><secondary-title>Monographs of the Western North American Naturalist</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Monographs of the Western North American Naturalist</full-title></periodical><pages>1-20</pages><volume>7</volume><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70125277</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bursik, M</author><author>K, Siehm</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Digital Database of the Holocene Tephras of the Mono-Inyo Craters , California</title></titles><pages>1-6</pages><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>758</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/758/data/monoinyodates.html%5Cnhttp://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/758/</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keeley, Jon E</author><author>Syphard, Alexandra D</author><author>Fotheringham, C J</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Boulter, Sarah</author><author>Palutikof, Jean</author><author>Karoly, David John</author><author>Guitart, Daniela</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>The 2003 and 2007 wildfires in southern California: Chapter 5 in Natural Disasters and Adaptation to Climate Change</title><secondary-title>Natural Disasters and Adaptation to Climate Change</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Natural Disasters and Adaptation to Climate Change</full-title></periodical><pages>42-52</pages><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Cambridge, United Kingdom</pub-location><publisher>Cambridge University Press</publisher><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70124301</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Richmond, Jonathan Q.</author><author>Barr, Kelly R.</author><author>Backlin, Adam R.</author><author>Vandergast, Amy G.</author><author>Fisher, Robert N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evolutionary dynamics of a rapidly receding southern range boundary in the threatened California Red-Legged Frog (Rana draytonii)</title><secondary-title>Evolutionary Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Evolutionary Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>808-822</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Conservation genetics</keyword><keyword>Phylogeography</keyword><keyword>Range edge - empirical</keyword><keyword>Ranid frogs</keyword><keyword>Wildlife management</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1752-4571</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/eva.12067</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Populations forming the edge of a species range are often imperiled by isolation and low genetic diversity, with proximity to human population centers being a major determinant of edge stability in modern landscapes.

We studied the genetic structure and diversity of these frontline populations, tested for signatures of contemporary disturbance, specifically fire, and attempted to disentangle these signals from demographic events extending deeper into the past. Consistent with the genetic expectations of the ‘abundant-center’ model, we found that diversity, admixture, and opportunity for random mating increases in populations sampled successively further away from the range boundary. Demo- graphic simulations indicate that bottlenecks in peripheral isolates are associated with processes extending tens to a few hundred generations in the past, despite the demographic collapse of some due to recent fire-flood events. While the effects of recent disturbance have left little genetic imprint on these populations, they likely contribute to an extinction debt that will lead to continued range con- traction unless management intervenes to stall or reverse the process. Introduction A variety of evolutionary and ecological phenomena create greater instability in populations at the edge of a species’ distribution compared with those located more toward the interior. These can include maladaptation to environments at or beyond the current boundary, increased competition with other species, reduced immigration due to greater iso- lation, low genetic diversity, smaller effective population sizes, or interactions between these and other variables (Holt 2003; Angert and Schemske 2005; Eckert et al. 2008; Hardie and Hutchings 2010). When anthropogenic stres- sors are added to the equation (e.g., urbanization, fires, introduction of non-native species, pollutants, etc.), persis- tence at the range boundary becomes even more difficult because the temporal scales over which these stressors operate often do not allow sufficient time for adaptation, particularly for species with long generation times or habi- tat specialization. This problem can be exacerbated if the range edge interfaces with human population centers,</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70125371</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moody, John A.</author><author>Shakesby, Richard A.</author><author>Robichaud, Peter R.</author><author>Cannon, Susan H.</author><author>Martin, Deborah A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Current research issues related to post-wildfire runoff and erosion processes</title><secondary-title>Earth-Science Reviews</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Earth-Science Reviews</full-title></periodical><pages>10-37</pages><volume>122</volume><keywords><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Burn severity</keyword><keyword>Runoff</keyword><keyword>Meso-scale rainfall</keyword><keyword>Soil erosion</keyword><keyword>Soil-hydraulic properties</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0012-8252</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.earscirev.2013.03.004</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Research into post-wildfire effects began in the United States more than 70. years ago and only later extended to other parts of the world. Post-wildfire responses are typically transient, episodic, variable in space and time, dependent on thresholds, and involve multiple processes measured by different methods. These characteristics tend to hinder research progress, but the large empirical knowledge base amassed in different regions of the world suggests that it should now be possible to synthesize the data and make a substantial improvement in the understanding of post-wildfire runoff and erosion response. Thus, it is important to identify and prioritize the research issues related to post-wildfire runoff and erosion. Priority research issues are the need to: (1) organize and synthesize similarities and differences in post-wildfire responses between different fire-prone regions of the world in order to determine common patterns and generalities that can explain cause and effect relations; (2) identify and quantify functional relations between metrics of fire effects and soil hydraulic properties that will better represent the dynamic and transient conditions after a wildfire; (3) determine the interaction between burned landscapes and temporally and spatially variable meso-scale precipitation, which is often the primary driver of post-wildfire runoff and erosion responses; (4) determine functional relations between precipitation, basin morphology, runoff connectivity, contributing area, surface roughness, depression storage, and soil characteristics required to predict the timing, magnitudes, and duration of floods and debris flows from ungaged burned basins; and (5) develop standard measurement methods that will ensure the collection of uniform and comparable runoff and erosion data. Resolution of these issues will help to improve conceptual and computer models of post-wildfire runoff and erosion processes. © 2013.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70118301</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jones, Benjamin M.</author><author>Breen, Amy L.</author><author>Gaglioti, Benjamin V.</author><author>Mann, Daniel H.</author><author>Rocha, Adrian V.</author><author>Grosse, Guido</author><author>Arp, Christopher D.</author><author>Kunz, Michael L.</author><author>Walker, Donald A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identification of unrecognized tundra fire events on the north slope of Alaska</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences</full-title></periodical><pages>1334-1344</pages><volume>118</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>fire</keyword><keyword>Arctic</keyword><keyword>tundra</keyword><keyword>North Slope</keyword><keyword>shrubs</keyword><keyword>Thermokarst</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2169-8961</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jgrg.20113</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Abstract [1] Characteristics of the natural fire regime are poorly resolved in the Arctic, even though fire may play an important role cycling carbon stored in tundra vegetation and soils to the atmosphere.

The REA provides an assessment of baseline ecological conditions, an evaluation of current risks from drivers of ecosystem change, and a predictive capacity for evaluating future risks. The REA also may be used for identifying priority areas for conservation or restoration and for assessing the cumulative effects of a variety of land uses. There are several components of the REAs. Management Questions (MQs), developed by the BLM and partners for the ecoregion, identify the information needed for addressing land-management responsibilities. Conservation Elements (CEs) represent regionally significant aquatic and terrestrial species and communities that are to be conserved and (or) restored. Coarse-filter CEs include ecological communities and ecosystems and Fine-filter CEs include plant and animal species or assemblages of similar species. For each CE, key ecological attributes will be evaluated to determine CE status. The REA also will evaluate major drivers of ecosystem change [Change Agents (CA)] currently affecting or likely to affect the status of CEs in the future. The relationships between CAs and key ecological attributes will be summarized using conceptual models. The REA process is a two-phase process. Phase I (pre-assessment) includes developing and finalizing the lists of priority MQs, CEs, and CAs, and culminates in the REA work plan, which defines the process that will be used for conducting the assessment. Phase II (assessment) comprises three tasks related to the compilation, documentation, and analyses of datasets to address MQs and complete the ecoregional assessment. The purpose of the work plan for the Wyoming Basin REA is to document the selection process for, and final list of, MQs, CEs, and CAs developed during Phase I. The work plan also presents the overall assessment framework that will be used to assess the status of CEs and answer MQs.</abstract><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20131223</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Middleton, Beth A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rediscovering traditional vegetation management in preserves: Trading experiences between cultures and continents</title><secondary-title>Biological Conservation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biological Conservation</full-title></periodical><pages>271-279</pages><volume>158</volume><keywords><keyword>Fire management</keyword><keyword>Natural disturbance</keyword><keyword>Cattle/bison grazing</keyword><keyword>Farm abandonment</keyword><keyword>Land use change</keyword><keyword>Landscape biodiversity</keyword><keyword>Protected area management</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0006-3207</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.biocon.2012.10.003</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Land managers are grappling with massive changes in vegetation structure, particularly in protected areas formerly subjected to fire and grazing. The objective of this review was to compare notes on the historical and current management of ecosystems around the world (especially in wet to dry grasslands in the Americas, Australia, Africa, Europe and Asia) with respect to the usage of fire, grazing and cutting to reduce dominance and support the biodiversity of rare species. This review suggests that former disturbances, which are now often lost, may have once kept tall vegetation from pushing out rarer subdominant species. In cases where prehistoric biodiversity depended on fire or large ungulate grazing, traditional agricultural and indigenous practices may have carried biodiversity forward to historical times by mimicking pre-cultural disturbances (e.g., lightning fire and bison grazing). Ironically, biodiversity related to species richness, landscape heterogeneity and function may decline in preserves, especially if traditional management once maintained this biodiversity. Managers can benefit from a cross-continental comparison of the full arsenal of management techniques used to control encroaching vegetation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70046417</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gergely, Kevin J</author><author>McKerrow, Alexa</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Terrestrial ecosystems: national inventory of vegetation and land use</title></titles><pages>1-1</pages><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2013-3085</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/fs20133085</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shinneman, Douglas J.</author><author>Baker, William L.</author><author>Rogers, Paul C.</author><author>Kulakowski, Dominik</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fire regimes of quaking aspen in the Mountain West</title><secondary-title>Forest Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forest Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>22-34</pages><volume>299</volume><keywords><keyword>Fire regime</keyword><keyword>Classification</keyword><keyword>Populus tremuloides</keyword><keyword>Seral</keyword><keyword>Stable</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0378-1127</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.foreco.2012.11.032</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) is the most widespread tree species in North America, and it is found throughout much of the Mountain West (MW) across a broad range of bioclimatic regions. Aspen typically regenerates asexually and prolifically after fire, and due to its seral status in many western conifer forests, aspen is often considered dependent upon disturbance for persistence. In many landscapes, historical evidence for post-fire aspen establishment is clear, and following extended fire-free periods senescing or declining aspen overstories sometimes lack adequate regeneration and are succeeding to conifers. However, aspen also forms relatively stable stands that contain little or no evidence of historical fire. In fact, aspen woodlands range from highly fire-dependent, seral communities to relatively stable, self-replacing, non-seral communities that do not require fire for persistence. Given the broad geographic distribution of aspen, fire regimes in these forests likely co-vary spatially with changing community composition, landscape setting, and climate, and temporally with land use and climate - but relatively few studies have explicitly focused on these important spatiotemporal variations. Here we reviewed the literature to summarize aspen fire regimes in the western US and highlight knowledge gaps. We found that only about one-fourth of the 46 research papers assessed for this review could be considered fire history studies (in which mean fire intervals were calculated), and all but one of these were based primarily on data from fire-scarred conifers. Nearly half of the studies reported at least some evidence of persistent aspen in the absence of fire. We also found that large portions of the MW have had little or no aspen fire history research. As a result of this review, we put forth a classification framework for aspen that is defined by key fire regime parameters (fire severity and probability), and that reflects underlying biophysical settings and correlated aspen functional types. We propose the following aspen fire regime types: (1) fire-independent, stable aspen; (2) fire-influenced, stable aspen; (3) fire-dependent, seral, conifer-aspen mix; (4) fire-dependent, seral, montane aspen-conifer; and (5) fire-dependent, seral, subalpine aspen-conifer. Closing research gaps and validating our proposed aspen fire regime classification will likely require additional site-specific research, enhanced dendrochronology techniques, charcoal and pollen record analysis, spatially-explicit modeling, and other techniques. We hope to encourage development of site-appropriate disturbance ecology characterizations, in order to aid efforts to manage and restore aspen communities and to diagnose key factors contributing to changes in aspen. © 2012.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70047014</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hossack, Blake R.</author><author>Lowe, Winsor H.</author><author>Corn, Paul Stephen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rapid Increases and Time-Lagged Declines in Amphibian Occupancy after Wildfire</title><secondary-title>Conservation Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Conservation Biology</full-title></periodical><pages>219-228</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Climate change</keyword><keyword>Disturbance</keyword><keyword>Colonization</keyword><keyword>Detection</keyword><keyword>Extinction</keyword><keyword>Population dynamics</keyword><keyword>Fire severity</keyword><keyword>Isolation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1523-1739</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1523-1739.2012.01921.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of drought and wildfire. Aquatic and moisture-sensitive species, such as amphibians, may be particularly vulnerable to these modified disturbance regimes because large wildfires often occur during extended droughts and thus may compound environmental threats. However, understanding of the effects of wildfires on amphibians in forests with long fire-return intervals is limited. Numerous stand-replacing wildfires have occurred since 1988 in Glacier National Park (Montana, U.S.A.), where we have conducted long-term monitoring of amphibians. We measured responses of 3 amphibian species to fires of different sizes, severity, and age in a small geographic area with uniform management. We used data from wetlands associated with 6 wildfires that burned between 1988 and 2003 to evaluate whether burn extent and severity and interactions between wildfire and wetland isolation affected the distribution of breeding populations. We measured responses with models that accounted for imperfect detection to estimate occupancy during prefire (0-4 years) and different postfire recovery periods. For the long-toed salamander (Ambystoma macrodactylum) and Columbia spotted frog (Rana luteiventris), occupancy was not affected for 6 years after wildfire. But 7-21 years after wildfire, occupancy for both species decreased ≥ 25% in areas where &gt;50% of the forest within 500 m of wetlands burned. In contrast, occupancy of the boreal toad (Anaxyrus boreas) tripled in the 3 years after low-elevation forests burned. This increase in occupancy was followed by a gradual decline. Our results show that accounting for magnitude of change and time lags is critical to understanding population dynamics of amphibians after large disturbances. Our results also inform understanding of the potential threat of increases in wildfire frequency or severity to amphibians in the region.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70043780</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Littell, Jeremy S</author><author>Hicke, Jeffrey A</author><author>Shafer, Sarah L</author><author>Capalbo, Susan M</author><author>Houston, Laurie L</author><author>Glick, Patty</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Forest ecosystems: Vegetation, disturbance, and economics: Chapter 5</title><secondary-title>Climate Change in the Northwest: Implications for Our Landscapes, Waters, and Communities</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Climate Change in the Northwest: Implications for Our Landscapes, Waters, and Communities</full-title></periodical><pages>110-148</pages><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Island Press/Center for Resource Economics</publisher><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70048492</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barrett, Kirsten</author><author>Valentim, Judson</author><author>Turner, B.

Deforestation losses include wildlife and human habitat, and myriad forest products on which rural and urban societies depend for food, fiber, fuel, fresh water, medicine, and recreation. Ecosystem services gained in the transition from forests to pasture and croplands, however, are often ignored in assessments of the impact of land cover change. The role of converted lands in tropical areas in terms of carbon uptake and storage is largely unknown. Pastures represent the fastest-growing form of converted land use in the tropics, even in some areas of rapid urban expansion. Tree biomass stored in these areas spans a broad range, depending on tree cover. Trees in pasture increase carbon storage, provide shade for cattle, and increase productivity of forage material. As a result, increasing fractional tree cover can provide benefits land managers as well as important ecosystem services such as reducing conversion pressure on forests adjacent to pastures. This study presents an estimation of fractional tree cover in pasture in a dynamic region on the verge of large-scale land use change. An appropriate sampling interval is established for similar studies, one that balances the need for independent samples of sufficient number to characterize a pasture in terms of fractional tree cover. This information represents a useful policy tool for government organizations and NGOs interested in encouraging ecosystem services on converted lands. Using high spatial resolution remotely sensed imagery, fractional tree cover in pasture is quantified for the municipality of Rio Branco, Brazil. A semivariogram and devolving spatial resolution are employed to determine the coarsest sampling interval that may be used, minimizing effects of spatial autocorrelation. The coarsest sampling interval that minimizes spatial dependence was about 22 m. The area-weighted fractional tree cover for the study area was 1.85 %, corrected for a slight bias associated with the coarser sampling resolution. The pastures sampled for fractional tree cover were divided between 'high' and 'low' tree cover, which may be the result of intentional incorporation of arboreal species in pasture. Further research involving those ranchers that have a higher fractional tree cover may indicate ways to promote the practice on a broader scale in the region.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70045526</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Polo, John A.</author><author>Hallgren, Stephen W.</author><author>Leslie, David M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effect of long-term understory prescribed burning on standing and down dead woody material in dry upland oak forests</title><secondary-title>Forest Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forest Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>128-135</pages><volume>291</volume><keywords><keyword>Coarse woody debris</keyword><keyword>Snags</keyword><keyword>Fine woody debris</keyword><keyword>Quercus marilandica</keyword><keyword>Quercus stellata</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>03781127</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.foreco.2012.10.048</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Dead woody material, long ignored or viewed as a nuisance for forest management, has gained appreciation for its many roles in the forest including wildlife habitat, nutrient storage and cycling, energy for trophic webs, protection of soil, fuel for fire and carbon storage. The growing interest in managing dead woody material has created strong demand for greater understanding of factors controlling amounts and turnover. Prescribed burning, an important management tool, may have strong effects of dead woody material given fire's capacity to create and consume dead woody material. We determined effects of long-term understory prescribed burning on standing and down woody material in upland oak forests in south-central North America. We hypothesized that as frequency of fire increased in these stands the amount of deadwood would decrease and the fine woody material would decrease more rapidly than coarse woody material. The study was conducted in forests dominated by post oak (Quercus stellata) and blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica) in wildlife management areas where understory prescribed burning had been practiced for over 20years and the range of burn frequencies was 0 (unburned) fires per decade (FPD) to 4.6 FPD. The amount of deadwood was low compared with more productive forests in southeastern North America. The biomass (24.7Mgha-1) and carbon stocks (11.7Mgha-1) were distributed among standing dead (22%), coarse woody debris (CWD, dia.&gt;7.5cm., 12%), fine woody debris (FWD, dia.7.5cm., 23%), and forest floor (43%). There was no evidence that understory prescribed burning influenced the amount and size distribution of standing and down dead woody material. There were two explanations for the lack of a detectable effect. First, a high incidence of severe weather including ice storms and strong winds that produce large amounts of deadwood intermittently in an irregular pattern across the landscape may preclude detecting a strong effect of understory prescribed burning. Second, fire suppression during the first one-half of the 20th Century may have led to encroachment of woody plants into forest gaps and savannas creating a patchwork of young and old stands that produced deadwood of different sizes and at different rates. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70148698</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hansen, M.

In this study, Earth observation satellite data were used to map global forest loss (2.3 million square kilometers) and gain (0.8 million square kilometers) from 2000 to 2012 at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil's well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70048671</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baron, J.

These changes to the forest have received considerable attention as they elevate concerns regarding the outcome of wildland fire. However, attempts to reduce biomass through fuel reduction (i.e., thinning of trees) are often opposed by public interest groups whose objectives include maintaining habitat for species of concern such as the spotted owl, Strix occidentalis, the northern goshawk, Accipiter gentilis, and the Pacific fisher, Martes pennanti. Whether protection of these upper-trophic level species confers adequate conservation of avian forest diversity is unknown.Methodology and Principal FindingsWe use a multi-species occurrence model to estimate the habitat associations of 47 avian species detected at 742 sampling locations within an 880-km2 area in the Sierra Nevada. Our approach, which accounts for variations in detectability of species, estimates occurrence probabilities of all species in a community by linking species occurrence models into one hierarchical community model, thus improving inferences on all species, especially those that are rare or observed infrequently. We address how the avian community is influenced by covariates related to canopy cover, tree size and shrub cover while accounting for the impacts of abiotic variables known to affect species distributions.Conclusions and SignificanceEnvironmental parameters estimated through our approach emphasize the importance of within and between stand-level heterogeneity in meeting biodiversity objectives and suggests that many avian species would increase under more open canopy habitat conditions than those favored by umbrella species of high conservation concern. Our results suggest that a more integrated approach that emphasizes maintaining a diversity of habitats across environmental gradients and minimizing urbanization may have a greater benefit to ecosystem functioning then a single-species management focus.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70046252</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reed, Sasha C</author><author>Belnap, Jayne</author><author>Floyd-Hanna, Lisa</author><author>Crews, Tim</author><author>Herring, Jack</author><author>Hanna, Dave</author><author>Miller, Mark E</author><author>Duniway, Michael C</author><author>Roybal, Carla M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessing the risk of nitrogen deposition to natural resources in the Four Corners area</title></titles><pages>1-53</pages><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70128265</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Madej, Mary A.</author><author>Seney, Joseph</author><author>Van Mantgem, Philip</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of road decommissioning on carbon stocks, losses, and emissions in north coastal california</title><secondary-title>Restoration Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Restoration Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>439-446</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Redwood</keyword><keyword>Reforestation</keyword><keyword>Road removal</keyword><keyword>Soil organic carbon</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1526-100X.2012.00911.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>During the last 3 decades, many road removal projects have been implemented on public and private lands in the United States to reduce erosion and other impacts from abandoned or unmaintained forest roads. Although effective in decreasing sediment production from roads, such activities have a carbon (C) cost as well as representing a carbon savings for an ecosystem. We assessed the carbon budget implications of 30 years of road decommissioning in Redwood National Park in north coastal California. Road restoration techniques, which evolved during the program, were associated with various carbon costs and savings. Treatment of 425 km of logging roads from 1979 to 2009 saved 72,000 megagrams (Mg) C through on-site soil erosion prevention, revegetation, and soil development on formerly compacted roads. Carbon sequestration will increase in time as forests and soils develop more fully on the restored sites. The carbon cost for this road decommissioning work, based on heavy equipment and vehicle fuel emissions, short-term soil loss, and clearing of vegetation, was 23,000 Mg C, resulting in a net carbon savings of 49,000 Mg C to date. Nevertheless, the degree to which soil loss is a carbon sink or source in steep mountainous watersheds needs to be further examined. The ratio of carbon costs to savings will differ by ecosystem and road removal methodology, but the procedure outlined here to assess carbon budgets on restoration sites should be transferable to other systems.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70041314</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Staley, Dennis M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Emergency assessment of post-fire debris-flow hazards for the 2013 Rim Fire, Stanislaus National Forest and Yosemite National Park, California</title></titles><pages>15-15</pages><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2013-1260</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20131260</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ebel, Brian A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Wildfire and Aspect Effects on Hydrologic States after the 2010 Fourmile Canyon Fire</title><secondary-title>Vadose Zone Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Vadose Zone Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>0-0</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1539-1663</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2136/vzj2012.0089</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Wildfire is one of the most significant disturbances in mountainous landscapes, affecting water supply and ecologic function and setting the stage for natural hazards such as flash floods. The impacts of wildfire can affect the entire hydrologic cycle. Measurements of soil-water content and matric potential in the near surface (top 30 cm) captured the hydrologic state in both burned and unburned hillslopes during the first spring through fall period (1 June--1 Oct. 2011) after the 2010 Fourmile Canyon Fire near Boulder, CO. This time span included different hydrologic periods characterized by cyclonic frontal storms (low-intensity, long duration), convective storms (high-intensity, short duration), and dry periods. In mountainous environments, aspect can also control hydrologic states, so north- vs. south-facing slopes were compared. Wildfire tended to homogenize soil-water contents across aspects and with depth in the soil, yet it also may have introduced an aspect control on matric potential that was not observed in unburned soils. Post-wildfire changes in hydrologic state were observed in south-facing soils, probably reflecting decreased soil-water retention after wildfire. North-facing soils were impacted the most, in terms of hydrologic state, by the loss of water storage in the combusted litter--duff layer and forest canopy, which had provided a large ``hydrologic buffering'' capacity when unburned. Unsaturated zone measurements showed increased variability in hydrologic states and more rapid state transitions in wildfire-impacted soils. A simple, qualitative analysis suggested that the range of unsaturated-zone processes along the gravity--capillarity--adsorption continuum was expanded by wildfire for a given soil. The small number of experimental plots in this study suggests that further work is needed before these conclusions can be generalized to other geographic areas.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.soils.org/publications/vzj/abstracts/12/1/vzj2012.0089</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barrett, Kirsten</author><author>Kasischke, Eric S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Controls on variations in MODIS fire radiative power in Alaskan boreal forests: Implications for fire severity conditions</title><secondary-title>Remote Sensing of Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Remote Sensing of Environment</full-title></periodical><pages>171-181</pages><volume>130</volume><keywords><keyword>Fire</keyword><keyword>Boreal</keyword><keyword>Fire intensity</keyword><keyword>Fire severity</keyword><keyword>Fire radiative power</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0034-4257</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.rse.2012.11.017</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fire activity in the Alaskan boreal forest, though episodic at annual and intra-annual time scales, has experienced an increase over the last several decades. Increases in burned area and fire severity are not only releasing more carbon to the atmosphere, but likely shifting vegetation composition in the region towards greater deciduous dominance and a reduction in coniferous stands. While some recent studies have addressed qualitative differences between large and small fire years in the Alaskan boreal forest, the ecological effects of a greater proportion of burning occurring during large fire years and during late season fires have not yet been examined.Some characteristics of wildfires that can be detected remotely are related to fire severity and can provide new information on spatial and temporal patterns of burning. This analysis focused on boreal wildfire intensity (fire radiative power, or FRP) contained in the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily active fire product from 2003 to 2010. We found that differences in FRP resulted from seasonality and intra-annual variability in fire activity levels, vegetation composition, latitudinal variation, and fire spread behavior.Our studies determined two general categories of active fire detections: new detections associated with the spread of the fire front and residual pixels in areas that had already experienced front burning. Residual pixels had a lower average FRP than front pixels, but represented a high percentage of all pixels during periods of high fire activity (large fire years, late season burning, and seasonal periods of high fire activity). As a result, the FRP from periods of high fire activity was less intense than those from periods of low fire activity. Differences related to latitude were greater than expected, with higher latitudes burning later in the season and at a higher intensity than lower latitudes. Differences in vegetation type indicate that coniferous vegetation is the most fire prone, but deciduous vegetation is not particularly fire resistant, as the proportion of active fire detections in deciduous stands is roughly the same as the fraction of deciduous vegetation in the region.Qualitative differences between periods of high and low fire activity are likely to reflect important differences in fire severity. Large fire years are likely to be more severe, characterized by more late season fires and a greater proportion of residual burning. Given the potential for severe fires to effect changes in vegetation cover, the shift toward a greater proportion of area burning during large fire years may influence vegetation patterns in the region over the medium to long term. ?? 2012.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70045522</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kolden, Crystal A.</author><author>Rogan, John</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mapping Wildfire Burn Severity in the Arctic Tundra from Downsampled MODIS Data</title><secondary-title>Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research</full-title></periodical><pages>64-76</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1523-0430</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1657/1938-4246-45.1.64</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Wildfires are historically infrequent in the arctic tundra, but are projected to increase with climate warming. Fire effects on tundra ecosystems are poorly understood and difficult to quantify in a remote region where a short growing season severely limits ground data collection. Remote sensing has been widely utilized to characterize wildfire regimes, but primarily from the Landsat sensor, which has limited data acquisition in the Arctic. Here, coarse-resolution remotely sensed data are assessed as a means to quantify wildfire burn severity of the 2007 Anaktuvuk River Fire in Alaska, the largest tundra wildfire ever recorded on Alaska's North Slope. Data from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and downsampled Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were processed to spectral indices and correlated to observed metrics of surface, subsurface, and comprehensive bum severity. Spectral indices were strongly correlated to surface severity (maximum R-2 = 0.88) and slightly less strongly correlated to substrate severity. Downsampled MODIS data showed a decrease in severity one year post-fire, corroborating rapid vegetation regeneration observed on the burned site. These results indicate that widely-used spectral indices and downsampled coarse-resolution data provide a reasonable supplement to often-limited ground data collection for analysis and long-term monitoring of wildfire effects in arctic ecosystems.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1657/1938-4246-45.1.64</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yelenik, Stephanie</author><author>Perakis, Steven</author><author>Hibbs, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Regional constraints to biological nitrogen fixation in post-fire forest communities</title><secondary-title>Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>739-750</pages><volume>94</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Biological nitrogen fixation</keyword><keyword>Climate gradient</keyword><keyword>Klamath National Forest</keyword><keyword>P fertilization</keyword><keyword>Plant competition</keyword><keyword>Soil nitrogen</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0012-9658 (Print)\n0012-9658 (Linking)</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1890/12-0278.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is a key ecological process that can restore nitrogen (N) lost in wildfire and shape the pace and pattern of post-fire forest recovery. To date, there is limited information on how climate and soil fertility interact to influence different pathways of BNF in early forest succession. We studied asymbiotic (forest floor and soil) and symbiotic (the shrub Ceanothus integerrimus) BNF rates across six sites in the Klamath National Forest, California, USA. We used combined gradient and experimental phosphorus (P) fertilization studies to explore cross-site variation in BNF rates and then related these rates to abiotic and biotic variables. We estimate that our measured BNF rates 22 years after wildfire (6.1-12.1 kg N x ha(-1) x yr(-1)) are unlikely to fully replace wildfire N losses. We found that asymbiotic BNF is P limited, although this is not the case for symbiotic BNF in Ceanothus. In contrast, Ceanothus BNF is largely driven by competition from other vegetation: in high-productivity sites with high potential evapotranspiration (Et), shrub biomass is suppressed as tree biomass increases. Because shrub biomass governed cross-site variation in Ceanothus BNF, this competitive interaction led to lower BNF in sites with high productivity and Et. Overall, these results suggest that the effects of nutrients play a larger role in driving asymbiotic than symbiotic fixation across our post-fire sites. However, because symbiotic BNF is 8-90x greater than asymbiotic BNF, it is interspecific plant competition that governs overall BNF inputs in these forests.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70045387</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, Decheng</author><author>Liu, Shuguang</author><author>Oeding, Jennifer</author><author>Zhao, Shuqing</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Forest cutting and impacts on carbon in the eastern United States</title><secondary-title>Scientific Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Reports</full-title></periodical><volume>3</volume><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/srep03547</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Forest cutting is a major anthropogenic disturbance that affects forest carbon (C) storage and fluxes.

However, the mechanisms that would cause such shifts are uncertain. Natural and anthropogenic fires have shaped the distributions of many plant species, but their effects have seldom been included in future projections of species ranges. Here, we examine how the combination of climate and fire influence historical and future distributions of the ponderosa pine-prairie ecotone at the edge of the Black Hills in South Dakota, USA, as simulated by MC1, a dynamic global vegetation model that includes the effects of fire, climate, and atmospheric CO2 concentration on vegetation dynamics. For this purpose, we parameterized MC1 for ponderosa pine in the Black Hills, designating the revised model as MC1-WCNP. Results show that fire frequency, as affected by humidity and temperature, is central to the simulation of historical prairies in the warmer lowlands versus woodlands in the cooler, moister highlands. Based on three downscaled general circulation model climate projections for the 21st century, we simulate greater frequencies of natural fire throughout the area due to substantial warming and, for two of the climate projections, lower relative humidity. However, established ponderosa pine forests are relatively fire resistant, and areas that were initially wooded remained so over the 21st century for most of our future climate x fire management scenarios. This result contrasts with projections for ponderosa pine based on climatic niches, which suggest that its suitable habitat in the Black Hills will be greatly diminished by the middle of the 21st century. We hypothesize that the differences between the future predictions from these two approaches are due in part to the inclusion of fire effects in MC1, and we highlight the importance of accounting for fire as managed by humans in assessing both historical species distributions and future climate change effects.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70056510</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Studd, Sarah</author><author>Fallon, Elizabeth</author><author>Crumbacher, Laura</author><author>Drake, Sam</author><author>Villarreal, Miguel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vegetation inventory, mapping, and classification report, Fort Bowie National Historic Site</title></titles><pages>122-122</pages><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Fort Collins, CO</pub-location><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70046809</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lockyer, Zachary B.</author><author>Coates, Peter S.</author><author>Casazza, Michael L.</author><author>Espinosa, Shawn</author><author>Delehanty, David J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Greater Sage-Grouse Nest Predators in the Virginia Mountains of Northwestern Nevada</title><secondary-title>Journal of Fish and Wildlife Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Fish and Wildlife Management</full-title></periodical><pages>242-255</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3996/122012-JFWM-110R1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Greater sage-grouse Centrocercus urophasianus, hereafter sage-grouse, populations have declined across their range due to the loss, degradation, and fragmentation of habitat. Habitat alterations can lead not only to vegetative changes but also to shifts in animal behavior and predator composition that may influence population vital rates, such as nest success. For example, common ravens Corvus corax are sage-grouse nest predators, and common raven abundance is positively associated with human-caused habitat alterations. Because nest success is a central component to sage-grouse population persistence, research that identifies factors influencing nest success will better inform conservation efforts. We used videography to unequivocally identify sage-grouse nest predators within the Virginia Mountains of northwestern Nevada, USA, from 2009 to 2011 and used maximum likelihood to calculate daily probability of nest survival. In the Virginia Mountains, fires, energy exploration, and other anthropogenic activities have altered historic sage-grouse habitat. We monitored 71 sage-grouse nests during the study, placing video cameras at 39 nests. Cumulative nest survival for all nests was 22.4% (95% CI, 13.0–33.4%), a survival rate that was significantly lower than other published results for sage-grouse in the Great Basin. Depredation was the primary cause for nest failure in our study (82.5%), and common ravens were the most frequent sage-grouse nest predator, accounting for 46.7% of nest depredations. We also successfully documented a suite of mammalian and reptilian species depredating sage-grouse nests, including some predators never previously confirmed in the literature to be sage-grouse nest predators (i.e., bobcats Lynx rufus and long-tailed weasels Mephitis frenata). Within the high elevation, disturbed habitat of the Virginia Mountains, low sage-grouse nest success may be limiting sage-grouse population growth. These results suggest that management actions that restore habitat in the Virginia Mountains and decrease anthropogenic subsidies of ravens will benefit sage-grouse.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.fwspubs.org/doi/abs/10.3996/122012-JFWM-110R1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book">6</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wimberly, Michael</author><author>Sohl, Terry L</author><author>Lamsal, Aashis</author><author>Liu, Zhihua</author><author>Hawbaker, Todd J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An integrated land change model for projecting future climate and land change scenarios</title></titles><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70101005</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Grabner, Keith W</author><author>Stambaugh, Michael C</author><author>Marschall, Joseph M</author><author>Abadir, Erin R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Oak woodlands and forests fire consortium: A regional view of fire science sharing</title></titles><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70048406</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Miller, Richard F</author><author>Chambers, Jeanne C</author><author>Pyke, David a</author><author>Pierson, Fred B</author><author>Williams, C Jason</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Review of Fire Effects on Vegetation and Soils in the Great Basin Region : Response and Ecological Site Characteristics</title></titles><pages>1-136</pages><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Fort Collins, CO</pub-location><isbn>0212-9426</isbn><abstract>This review synthesizes the state of knowledge on fire effects on vegetation and soils in semi-arid ecosystems in the Great Basin Region, including the central and northern Great Basin and Range, Columbia River Basin, and the Snake River Plain. We summarize available literature related to: (1) the effects of environmental gradients, ecological site, and vegetation characteristics on resilience to disturbance and resistance to invasive species; (2) the effects of fire on individual plant species and communities, biological soil crusts, seed banks, soil nutrients, and hydrology; and (3) the role of fire severity, fire versus fire surrogate treatments, and post-fire grazing in determining ecosystem response. From this, we identify knowledge gaps and present a framework for predicting plant successional trajectories following wild and prescribed fires and fire surrogate treatments. Possibly the three most important ecological site characteristics that influence a site’s resilience (ability of the ecological site to recover from disturbance) and resistance to invasive species are soil temperature/moisture regimes and the composition and structure of vegetation on the ecological site just prior to the disturbance event.

We sampled an unburned site and an adjacent prescribed burn site two to five years post fire in the spring and summer of 2007 through 2010. We found no differences in apparent survival or body condition of snakes between burned and unburned sites. the burned site had lower snake abundance than the unburned site in 2008 but we found no difference in abundance between sites in 2009 and 2010. We also found a difference in body condition across years and asymmetry in the probability of transition (movement between burned and unburned sites). Vegetation cover between the burned and unburned sites was similar. this study serves as a baseline for investigation of the effects of fire on Coluber constrictor mormon at our study site and provides further insight on the effects of prescribed fire on reptile species. © 2013.

In the Southern Rocky Mountains, a recent outbreak of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae; MPB) has caused remarkable levels of tree mortality. To evaluate the long-term impacts of both this insect outbreak and another characteristic disturbance in these forests, high-severity wildfire, we simulated potential changes in species composition and carbon stocks using the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS). Simulations were completed for 3 scenarios (no disturbance, actual MPB infestation, and modeled wildfire) using field data collected in 2010 at 97 plots in the lodgepole-pine-dominated forests of eastern Grand County, Colorado, which were heavily impacted by MPB after 2002. Results of the simulations showed that (1) lodgepole pine remained dominant over time in all scenarios, with basal area recovering to pre-disturbance levels 70-80 yr after disturbance; (2) wildfire caused a greater magnitude of change than did MPB in both patterns of succession and distribution of carbon among biomass pools; (3) levels of standing-live carbon returned to pre-disturbance conditions after 40 vs. 50 yr following MPB vs. wildfire disturbance, respectively, but took 120 vs. 150 yr to converge with conditions in the undisturbed scenario. Lodgepole pine forests appear to be relatively resilient to both of the disturbances we modeled, although changes in climate, future disturbance regimes, and other factors may significantly affect future rates of regeneration and ecosystem response.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.biogeosciences.net/10/8203/2013/</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hawbaker, Todd J.</author><author>Radeloff, Volker C.</author><author>Stewart, Susan I.</author><author>Hammer, Roger B.</author><author>Keuler, Nicholas S.</author><author>Clayton, Murray K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Human and biophysical influences on fire occurrence in the United States</title><secondary-title>Ecological Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>565-582</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Wildland-urban interface</keyword><keyword>Fire occurrence</keyword><keyword>MODIS active fires</keyword><keyword>Wildfire risk</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>April 2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1051-0761</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1890/12-1816.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>National-scale analyses of fire occurrence are needed to prioritize fire policy and management activities across the United States .

can pose a significant risk to people and property. Billions of dollars are spent investing in fire management actions in an attempt to reduce the risk of loss. One of the key areas where money is spent is through fuel treatment--either fuel reduction (prescribed fire) or fuel removal (fuel breaks). Individual treatments can influence fire size and the maximum distance travelled from the ignition and presumably risk, but few studies have examined the landscape level effectiveness of these treatments. Here we use a Bayesian Network model to examine the relative influence of the built and natural environment, weather, fuel and fuel treatments in determining the risk posed from wildfire to the wildland-urban interface. Fire size and distance travelled was influenced most strongly by weather, with exposure to fires most sensitive to changes in the built environment and fire parameters. Natural environment variables and fuel load all had minor influences on fire size, distance travelled and exposure of assets. These results suggest that management of fuels provided minimal reductions in risk to assets and adequate planning of the changes in the built environment to cope with the expansion of human populations is going to be vital for managing risk from fire under future climates.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70141779</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schuette, P.

However, native plant and animal species within these shrubland systems are increasingly exposed to human-caused wildfires and an expansion of the human-wildland interface. Few data exist to evaluate the effects of fire and anthropogenic pressures on plant and animal communities found in these environments. This is particularly true for carnivore communities. To address this knowledge gap, we collected detection-non-detection data with motion-sensor cameras and track plots to measure carnivore occupancy patterns following a large, human-caused wildfire (1134 km(2)) in eastern San Diego County, California, USA, in 2003. Our focal species set included coyote (Canis latrans), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), bobcat (Lynx rufus) and striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis). We evaluated the influence on species occupancies of the burned environment (burn edge, burn interior and unburned areas), proximity of rural homes, distance to riparian area and elevation. Gray fox occupancies were the highest overall, followed by striped skunk, coyote and bobcat. The three species considered as habitat and foraging generalists (gray fox, coyote, striped skunk) were common in all conditions. Occupancy patterns were consistent through time for all species except coyote, whose occupancies increased through time. In addition, environmental and anthropogenic variables had weak effects on all four species, and these responses were species-specific. Our results helped to describe a carnivore community exposed to frequent fire and rural human residences, and provide baseline data to inform fire management policy and wildlife management strategies in similar fire-prone ecosystems.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70115721</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gartner, Joseph E.</author><author>Cannon, Susan H.</author><author>Santi, Paul M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Empirical models for predicting volumes of sediment deposited by debris flows and sediment-laden floods in the transverse ranges of southern California</title><secondary-title>Engineering Geology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Engineering Geology</full-title></periodical><pages>45-56</pages><volume>176</volume><issue>24</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.enggeo.2014.04.008</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Debris flows and sediment-laden floods in the Transverse Ranges of southern California pose severe hazards to nearby communities and infrastructure. Frequent wildfires denude hillslopes and increase the likelihood of these hazardous events. Debris-retention basins protect communities and infrastructure from the impacts of debris flows and sediment-laden floods and also provide critical data for volumes of sediment deposited at watershed outlets. In this study, we supplement existing data for the volumes of sediment deposited at watershed outlets with newly acquired data to develop new empirical models for predicting volumes of sediment produced by watersheds located in the Transverse Ranges of southern California. The sediment volume data represent a broad sample of conditions found in Ventura, Los Angeles and San Bernardino Counties, California. The measured volumes of sediment, watershed morphology, distributions of burn severity within each watershed, the time since the most recent fire, triggering storm rainfall conditions, and engineering soil properties were analyzed using multiple linear regressions to develop two models. A “long-term model” was developed for predicting volumes of sediment deposited by both debris flows and floods at various times since the most recent fire from a database of volumes of sediment deposited by a combination of debris flows and sediment-laden floods with no time limit since the most recent fire (n=344). A subset of this database was used to develop an “emergency assessment model” for predicting volumes of sediment deposited by debris flows within two years of a fire (n=92). Prior to developing the models, 32 volumes of sediment, and related parameters for watershed morphology, burn severity and rainfall conditions were retained to independently validate the long-term model. Ten of these volumes of sediment were deposited by debris flows within two years of a fire and were used to validate the emergency assessment model. The models were validated by comparing predicted and measured volumes of sediment. These validations were also performed for previously developed models and identify that the models developed here best predict volumes of sediment for burned watersheds in comparison to previously developed models.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0013795214000891</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Perkins, Kim S.</author><author>Nimmo, John R.</author><author>Medeiros, Arthur C.</author><author>Szutu, Daphne J.</author><author>von Allmen, Erica</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessing effects of native forest restoration on soil moisture dynamics and potential aquifer recharge, Auwahi, Maui</title><secondary-title>Ecohydrology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecohydrology</full-title></periodical><pages>1437-1451</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Infiltration</keyword><keyword>Soil moisture</keyword><keyword>Reforestation</keyword><keyword>Aquifer recharge</keyword><keyword>Preferential flow</keyword><keyword>Unsaturated zone</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1936-0592</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/eco.1469</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Understanding the role of soils in regulating water flow through the unsaturated zone is critical in assessing the influence of vegetation on soil moisture dynamics and aquifer recharge. Because of fire, introduced ungulates and landscape-level invasion of non-native grasses, less than 10% of original dry forest (similar to 730mm precipitation annually) still exists on leeward Haleakal, Maui, Hawaiian Islands. Native dry forest restoration at Auwahi has demonstrated the potential for dramatic revegetation, allowing a unique experimental comparison of hydrologic function between tracts of restored forest and adjacent grasslands. We hypothesized that even relatively recent forest restoration can assist in the recovery of impaired hydrologic function, potentially increasing aquifer recharge. To compare restored forest and grassland sites, we experimentally irrigated and measured soil moisture and temperature with subsurface instrumentation at four locations within the reforested area and four within the grassland, each with a 25x25-m plot. Compared with grassland areas, water in reforested sites moved to depth faster with larger magnitude changes in water content. The median first arrival velocity of water was greater by a factor of about 13 in the reforested sites compared with the grassland sites. This rapid transport of water to depths of 1m or greater suggests increased potential aquifer recharge. Improved characterization of how vegetation and soils influence recharge is crucial for understanding the long-term impacts of forest restoration on aquifer recharge and water resources, especially in moisture-limited regions.

The Florida Everglades includes 6000-km2 of peat-accumulating wetland however, detailed carbon dynamics from different environments within the Everglades have not been extensively studied or compared. Here we present carbon accumulation rates from 13 cores and 4 different environments, including sawgrass ridges and sloughs, tree islands, and marl prairies, whose hydroperiods and vegetation communities differ. We find that the lowest rates of C accumulation occur in sloughs in the southern Everglades. The highest rates are found where hydroperiods are generally shorter, including near-tails of tree islands and drier ridges. Long-term average rates of 100 to &gt;200gCm-2yr-1are as high, and in some cases, higher than rates recorded from the tropics and 10-20 times higher than boreal averages. C accumulation rates were impacted by both the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age, but the largest impacts to C accumulation rates over the Holocene record have been the anthropogenic changes associated with expansion of agriculture and construction of canals and levees to control movement of surface water. Water management practices in the 20th century have altered the natural hydroperiods and fire regimes of the Everglades. The Florida Everglades as a whole has acted as a significant carbon sink over the mid- to late-Holocene, but reduction of the spatial extent of the original wetland area, as well as the alteration of natural hydrology in the late 19th and 20th centuries, have significantly reduced the carbon sink capacity of this subtropical wetland. © 2014.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70157147</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moody, John A.</author><author>Ebel, Brian A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Infiltration and runoff generation processes in fire-affected soils</title><secondary-title>Hydrological Processes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hydrological Processes</full-title></periodical><pages>3432-3453</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Peak discharge</keyword><keyword>Infiltration</keyword><keyword>Hillslope</keyword><keyword>Rainfall profile</keyword><keyword>Runoff initiation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1099-1085</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/hyp.9857</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Post-wildfire runoff was investigated by combining field measurements and modeling of infiltration into fire-affected soils to predict time-to-start of runoff and peak runoff rate at the plot scale (1 m2). Time series of soil-water content, rainfall, and runoff were measured on a hillslope burned by the 2010 Fourmile Canyon Fire west of Boulder, Colorado during cyclonic and convective rainstorms in the spring and summer of 2011. Some of the field measurements and measured soil physical properties were used to calibrate a one-dimensional post-wildfire numerical model, which was then used as a ‘virtual instrument’ to provide estimates of the saturated hydraulic conductivity and high-resolution (1 mm) estimates of the soil-water profile and water fluxes within the unsaturated zone. Field and model estimates of the wetting-front depth indicated that post- wildfire infiltration was on average confined to shallow depths less than 30 mm. Model estimates of the effective saturated hydraulic conductivity, Ks, near the soil surface ranged from 0.1 to 5.2 mm h-1. Because of the relatively small values of Ks, the time-to-start of runoff (measured from the start of rainfall), p t , was found to depend only on the initial soil-water saturation deficit (predicted by the model) and a measured characteristic of the rainfall profile (referred to as the mean rainfall acceleration, equal to the initial rate of change in rainfall intensity). An analytical model was developed from the combined results and explained 92-97% of the variance of p t , and the numerical infiltration model explained 74-91% of the variance of the peak runoff rates. These results are from one burned site, but they strongly suggest that p t in fire-affected soils (which often have low values of Ks) is probably controlled more by the storm profile and the initial soil-water saturation deficit than by soil hydraulic properties.

It is implicated in alterations of ecosystem structure and function and is the subject of many local control projects, including removal using heavy equipment. We evaluated short-term vegetation responses to mechanical Tamarix spp. removal at sites ranging from 2 to 5 yr post-treatment along the Virgin River in Nevada, USA. Treatments resulted in lower density and cover (but not eradication) of Tamarix spp., increased cover of the native shrub Pluchea sericia (arrow weed), decreased density and cover of all woody species combined, increased density of both native annual forbs and the nonnative annual Salsola tragus (prickly Russian-thistle), and lower density of nonnative annual grasses. The treated plots had lower mean woody species richness, but greater herbaceous species richness and diversity. Among herbaceous species, native taxa increased in richness whereas nonnative species increased in both species richness and diversity. Thus, efforts to remove Tamarix spp. at the Virgin River reduced vegetative cover contributing to fuel loads and probability of fire, and resulted in positive effects for native plant diversity, with mixed effects on other nonnative species. However, absolute abundances of native species and species diversity were very low, suggesting that targets of restoring vegetation to pre-invasion conditions were not met. Longer evaluation periods are needed to adequately evaluate how short-term post-treatment patterns translate to long-term patterns of plant community dynamics.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S1939729100003825/type/journal_article</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Drus, Gail M.</author><author>Dudley, Tom L.</author><author>D'Antonio, Carla M.</author><author>Even, Thomas J.</author><author>Brooks, Matt L.</author><author>Matchett, J.

Tamarix stands in the Humboldt Sink (NV, USA) were divided into three treatments: summer burn (August 2006), fall burn (October 2006) and control (unburned), and litter depth was manipulated to vary fire intensity within burn seasons. A gradient of existing herbivory impact was described with three plant condition metrics prior to fire: reduced proportions of green canopy, percent root crown starch sampled at the height of the growing season (August 2006), and percent root crown starch measured during dormancy (December 2006). August root crown starch concentration and proportion green canopy were strongly correlated, although the proportion green canopy predicted mortality better than August root crown starch. December root crown starch concentration was more depleted in unburned trees and in trees burned during the summer than in fall burn trees. Mortality in summer burned trees was higher than fall burned trees due to higher fire intensity, but December root crown starch available for resprouting in the spring was also lower in summer burned trees. The greatest mortality was observed in trees with the lowest December root crown starch concentration which were exposed to high fire intensity. Disproportionate changes in the slope and curvature of prediction traces as fire intensity and December starch reach reciprocal maximum and minimum levels indicate that beetle herbivory and fire intensity are synergistic. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70123855</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wylie, Bruce</author><author>Rigge, Matthew</author><author>Brisco, Brian</author><author>Murnaghan, Kevin</author><author>Rover, Jennifer</author><author>Long, Jordan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of disturbance and climate change on ecosystem performance in the Yukon River basin boreal forest</title><secondary-title>Remote Sensing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Remote Sensing</full-title></periodical><pages>9145-9169</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Climate change</keyword><keyword>Fire</keyword><keyword>Boreal</keyword><keyword>Forest composition</keyword><keyword>Succession</keyword><keyword>Future</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1605594652</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/rs6109145</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A warming climate influences boreal forest productivity, dynamics, and disturbance regimes. We used ecosystem models and 250 m satellite Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data averaged over the growing season (GSN) to model current, and estimate future, ecosystem performance. We modeled Expected Ecosystem Performance (EEP), or anticipated productivity, in undisturbed stands over the 2000–2008 period from a variety of abiotic data sources, using a rule-based piecewise regression tree. The EEP model was applied to a future climate ensemble A1B projection to quantify expected changes to mature boreal forest performance. Ecosystem Performance Anomalies (EPA), were identified as the residuals of the EEP and GSN relationship and represent performance departures from expected performance conditions. These performance data were used to monitor successional events following fire. Results suggested that maximum EPA occurs 30–40 years following fire, and deciduous stands generally have higher EPA than coniferous stands. Mean undisturbed EEP is projected to increase 5.6% by 2040 and 8.7% by 2070, suggesting an increased deciduous component in boreal forests. Our results contribute to the understanding of boreal forest successional dynamics and its response to climate change.

Prescribed fire and fire surrogate treatments (mowing, tebuthiuron, and imazapic) are used to reduce woody fuels and increase resistance to exotic annuals, but may alter resource availability and inadvertently favor invasive species. We used four study sites within the Sagebrush Steppe Treatment Evaluation Project (SageSTEP) to evaluate 1) how vegetation and soil resources were affected by treatment, and 2) how soil resources influenced native herbaceous perennial and exotic annual grass cover before and following treatment. Treatments increased resin exchangeable NH4+, NO3-, H2PO4-, and K+, with the largest increases caused by prescribed fire and prolonged by application of imazapic. Burning with imazapic application also increased the number of wet growing degree days. Tebuthiuron and imazapic reduced exotic annual grass cover, but imazapic also reduced herbaceous perennial cover when used with prescribed fire. Native perennial herbaceous species cover was higher where mean annual precipitation and soil water resources were relatively high. Exotic annual grass cover was higher where resin exchangeable H2PO4-was high and gaps between perennial plants were large. Prescribed fire, mowing, and tebuthiuron were successful at increasing perennial herbaceous cover, but the results were often ephemeral and inconsistent among sites. Locations with sandy soil, low mean annual precipitation, or low soil water holding capacity were more likely to experience increased exotic annual grass cover after treatment, and treatments that result in slow release of resources are needed on these sites. This is one of few studies that correlate abiotic variables to native and exotic species cover across a broad geographic setting, and that demonstrates how soil resources potentially influence the outcome of management treatments.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70128740</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Symstad, Amy J.</author><author>Newton, Wesley E.</author><author>Swanson, Daniel J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Strategies for preventing invasive plant outbreaks after prescribed fire in ponderosa pine forest</title><secondary-title>Forest Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forest Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>81-88</pages><volume>324</volume><keywords><keyword>Invasive plants</keyword><keyword>Prescribed fire</keyword><keyword>Fire severity</keyword><keyword>Cirsium arvense</keyword><keyword>Pinus ponderosa forest</keyword><keyword>Verbascum thapsus</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0378-1127</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.foreco.2014.04.022</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Land managers use prescribed fire to return a vital process to fire-adapted ecosystems, restore forest structure from a state altered by long-term fire suppression, and reduce wildfire intensity. However, fire often produces favorable conditions for invasive plant species, particularly if it is intense enough to reveal bare mineral soil and open previously closed canopies. Understanding the environmental or fire characteristics that explain post-fire invasive plant abundance would aid managers in efficiently finding and quickly responding to fire-caused infestations. To that end, we used an information-theoretic model-selection approach to assess the relative importance of abiotic environmental characteristics (topoedaphic position, distance from roads), pre-and post-fire biotic environmental characteristics (forest structure, understory vegetation, fuel load), and prescribed fire severity (measured in four different ways) in explaining invasive plant cover in ponderosa pine forest in South Dakota's Black Hills. Environmental characteristics (distance from roads and post-fire forest structure) alone provided the most explanation of variation (26%) in post-fire cover of Verbascum thapsus (common mullein), but a combination of surface fire severity and environmental characteristics (pre-fire forest structure and distance from roads) explained 36-39% of the variation in post-fire cover of Cirsium arvense (Canada thistle) and all invasives together. For four species and all invasives together, their pre-fire cover explained more variation (26-82%) in post-fire cover than environmental and fire characteristics did, suggesting one strategy for reducing post-fire invasive outbreaks may be to find and control invasives before the fire. Finding them may be difficult, however, since pre-fire environmental characteristics explained only 20% of variation in pre-fire total invasive cover, and less for individual species. Thus, moderating fire intensity or targeting areas of high severity for post-fire invasive control may be the most efficient means for reducing the chances of post-fire invasive plant outbreaks when conducting prescribed fires in this region. © 2014.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70112147</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wickham, James</author><author>Homer, Collin</author><author>Vogelmann, James</author><author>McKerrow, Alexa</author><author>Mueller, Rick</author><author>Herold, Nate</author><author>Coulston, John</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The multi-resolution land characteristics (MRLC) consortium - 20 years of development and integration of USA national land cover data</title><secondary-title>Remote Sensing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Remote Sensing</full-title></periodical><pages>7424-7441</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>LANDFIRE</keyword><keyword>Change detection</keyword><keyword>C-CAP</keyword><keyword>Cropland Data Layer (CDL)</keyword><keyword>GAP</keyword><keyword>NLCD</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/rs6087424</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium demonstrates the national benefits of USA Federal collaboration. Starting in the mid-1990s as a small group with the straightforward goal of compiling a comprehensive national Landsat dataset that could be used to meet agencies’ needs, MRLC has grown into a group of 10 USA Federal Agencies that coordinate the production of five different products, including the National Land Cover Database (NLCD), the Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP), the Cropland Data Layer (CDL), the Gap Analysis Program (GAP), and the Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools (LANDFIRE). As a set, the products include almost every aspect of land cover from impervious surface to detailed crop and vegetation types to fire fuel classes. Some products can be used for land cover change assessments because they cover multiple time periods. The MRLC Consortium has become a collaborative forum, where members share research, methodological approaches, and data to produce products using established protocols, and we believe it is a model for the production of integrated land cover products at national to continental scales. We provide a brief overview of each of the main products produced by MRLC and examples of how each product has been used. We follow that with a discussion of the impact of the MRLC program and a brief overview of future plans.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70134860</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Myers, P.

(Galliformes: Odontophoridae), population declines are well documented, but pinpointing the reasons for these decreases has proven elusive. Bobwhite population declines are attributed primarily to loss of habitat and land use changes. This, however, does not entirely explain population declines in areas intensively managed for bobwhites. Although previous research demonstrates the negative impact of red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta Buren) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) on northern bobwhites, the mechanisms underlying this effect are largely unknown. To meet the protein demands of early growth and development, bobwhite chicks predominantly consume small insects, of which ants are a substantial proportion. Fire ants alter ant community dynamics by often reducing native ant diversity and abundance while concurrently increasing the abundance of individuals. Fire ants have negative effects on chicks, but they are also a large potential protein source, making it difficult to disentangle their net effect on bobwhite chicks. To help investigate these effects, we conducted a laboratory experiment to understand (1) whether or not bobwhites consume fire ants, and (2) how the benefits of this consumption compare to the deleterious impacts of bobwhite chick exposure to fire ants. Sixty bobwhite chicks were separated into two groups of 30; one group was provided with starter feed only and the second group was provided with feed and fire ants. Bobwhite chicks were observed feeding on fire ants. Chicks that fed on fire ants had reduced survival and weight gain. Our results show that, while fire ants increase potential food sources for northern bobwhite, their net effect on bobwhite chicks is deleterious. This information will help inform land managers and commercial bobwhite rearing operations.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.3954/JAUE12-08.1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McIver, James</author><author>Brunson, Mark</author><author>Bunting, Steve</author><author>Chambers, Jeanne</author><author>Doescher, Paul</author><author>Grace, James</author><author>Hulet, April</author><author>Johnson, Dale</author><author>Knick, Steve</author><author>Miller, Richard</author><author>Pellant, Mike</author><author>Pierson, Fred</author><author>Pyke, David</author><author>Rau, Benjamin</author><author>Rollins, Kim</author><author>Roundy, Bruce</author><author>Schupp, Eugene</author><author>Tausch, Robin</author><author>Williams, Jason</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Synopsis of Short-Term Response to Alternative Restoration Treatments in Sagebrush-Steppe: The SageSTEP Project</title><secondary-title>Rangeland Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Rangeland Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>584-598</pages><volume>67</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Environmental gradients</keyword><keyword>Ecosystem management</keyword><keyword>Cheatgrass invasion</keyword><keyword>Ecological resilience</keyword><keyword>Sagebrush restoration</keyword><keyword>Woodland expansion</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1550-7424</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2111/REM-D-14-00084.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Sagebrush Steppe Treatment Evaluation Project (SageSTEP) is an integrated long-term study that evaluates ecological effects of alternative treatments designed to reduce woody fuels and to stimulate the herbaceous understory of sagebrush steppe communities of the Intermountain West. This synopsis summarizes results through 3 yr posttreatment. Woody vegetation reduction by prescribed fire, mechanical treatments, or herbicides initiated a cascade of effects, beginning with increased availability of nitrogen and soil water, followed by increased growth of herbaceous vegetation. Response of butterflies and magnitudes of runoff and erosion closely followed herbaceous vegetation recovery. Effects on shrubs, biological soil crust, tree cover, surface woody fuel loads, and sagebrush-obligate bird communities will take longer to be fully expressed. In the short term, cool wet sites were more resilient than warm dry sites, and resistance was mostly dependent on pretreatment herbaceous cover. At least 10 yr of posttreatment time will likely be necessary to determine outcomes for most sites. Mechanical treatments did not serve as surrogates for prescribed fire in how each influenced the fuel bed, the soil, erosion, and sage-obligate bird communities. Woody vegetation reduction by any means resulted in increased availability of soil water, higher herbaceous cover, and greater butterfly numbers. We identified several trade-offs (desirable outcomes for some variables, undesirable for others), involving most components of the study system. Trade-offs are inevitable when managing complex natural systems, and they underline the importance of asking questions about the whole system when developing management objectives. Substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity in sagebrush steppe ecosystems emphasizes the point that there will rarely be a "recipe" for choosing management actions on any specific area. Use of a consistent evaluation process linked to monitoring may be the best chance managers have for arresting woodland expansion and cheatgrass invasion that may accelerate in a future warming climate.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70128747</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chambers, Jeanne C.</author><author>Miller, Richard F.</author><author>Board, David I.</author><author>Pyke, David A.</author><author>Roundy, Bruce A.</author><author>Grace, James B.</author><author>Schupp, Eugene W.</author><author>Tausch, Robin J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Resilience and Resistance of Sagebrush Ecosystems: Implications for State and Transition Models and Management Treatments</title><secondary-title>Rangeland Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Rangeland Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>440-454</pages><volume>67</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Environmental gradients</keyword><keyword>Prescribed fire</keyword><keyword>Bromus tectorum invasion</keyword><keyword>Ecological sites</keyword><keyword>Mechanical treatments</keyword><keyword>Pinon and juniper expansion</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1550-7424</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2111/REM-D-13-00074.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In sagebrush ecosystems invasion of annual exotics and expansion of piñon (Pinus monophylla Torr. and Frem.) and juniper (Juniperus occidentalis Hook., J. osteosperma [Torr.] Little) are altering fire regimes and resulting in large-scale ecosystem transformations. Management treatments aim to increase resilience to disturbance and enhance resistance to invasive species by reducing woody fuels and increasing native perennial herbaceous species. We used Sagebrush Steppe Treatment Evaluation Project data to test predictions on effects of fire vs. mechanical treatments on resilience and resistance for three site types exhibiting cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) invasion and/or piñon and juniper expansion: 1) warm and dry Wyoming big sagebrush (WY shrub); 2) warm and moist Wyoming big sagebrush (WY PJ); and 3) cool and moist mountain big sagebrush (Mtn PJ). Warm and dry (mesic/aridic) WY shrub sites had lower resilience to fire (less shrub recruitment and native perennial herbaceous response) than cooler and moister (frigid/xeric) WY PJ and Mtn PJ sites. Warm (mesic) WY Shrub and WY PJ sites had lower resistance to annual exotics than cool (frigid to cool frigid) Mtn PJ sites. In WY shrub, fire and sagebrush mowing had similar effects on shrub cover and, thus, on perennial native herbaceous and exotic cover. In WY PJ and Mtn PJ, effects were greater for fire than cut-and-leave treatments and with high tree cover in general because most woody vegetation was removed increasing resources for other functional groups. In WY shrub, about 20% pretreatment perennial native herb cover was necessary to prevent increases in exotics after treatment. Cooler and moister WY PJ and especially Mtn PJ were more resistant to annual exotics, but perennial native herb cover was still required for site recovery. We use our results to develop state and transition models that illustrate how resilience and resistance influence vegetation dynamics and management options.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70128736</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lovich, J E</author><author>Agha, M</author><author>Yackulic, C B</author><author>Meyer-wilkins, K</author><author>Bentley-Condit, Vicki</author><author>Ennen, J R</author><author>Arundel, T R</author><author>Austin, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nest site characteristics, nesting movements, and lack of long- term nest site fidelity in Agassiz’s desert tortoises at a wind energy facility in southern California</title><secondary-title>California Fish and Game</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>California Fish and Game</full-title></periodical><pages>404-416</pages><volume>100</volume><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70140972</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gustine, David D.</author><author>Brinkman, Todd J.</author><author>Lindgren, Michael A.</author><author>Schmidt, Jennifer I.</author><author>Rupp, T.

A transforming wildfire regime is altering plant composition and successional patterns, thus affecting the distribution and potentially the abundance of large herbivores. Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) are an important subsistence resource for communities throughout the north and a species that depends on terrestrial lichen in late-successional forests and tundra systems. Projected increases in area burned and reductions in stand ages may reduce lichen availability within caribou winter ranges. Sufficient reductions in lichen abundance could alter the capacity of these areas to support caribou populations. To assess the potential role of a changing fire regime on winter habitat for caribou, we used a simulation modeling platform, two global circulation models (GCMs), and a moderate emissions scenario to project annual fire characteristics and the resulting abundance of lichen-producing vegetation types (i.e., spruce forests and tundra &gt;60 years old) across a modeling domain that encompassed the winter ranges of the Central Arctic and Porcupine caribou herds in the Alaskan-Yukon Arctic. Fires were less numerous and smaller in tundra compared to spruce habitats throughout the 90-year projection for both GCMs. Given the more likely climate trajectory, we projected that the Porcupine caribou herd, which winters primarily in the boreal forest, could be expected to experience a greater reduction in lichen-producing winter habitats (-21%) than the Central Arctic herd that wintered primarily in the arctic tundra (-11%). Our results suggest that caribou herds wintering in boreal forest will undergo fire-driven reductions in lichen-producing habitats that will, at a minimum, alter their distribution. Range shifts of caribou resulting from fire-driven changes to winter habitat may diminish access to caribou for rural communities that reside in fire-prone areas.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70118111</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Prouty, Nancy G.</author><author>Storlazzi, Curt D.</author><author>McCutcheon, Amanda L.</author><author>Jenson, John W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Historic impact of watershed change and sedimentation to reefs along west-central Guam</title><secondary-title>Coral Reefs</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Coral Reefs</full-title></periodical><pages>733-749</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Coral reefs</keyword><keyword>Geochemistry</keyword><keyword>Land-use change</keyword><keyword>Terrestrial sedimentation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00338-014-1166-x</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70104144</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gillan, Jeffrey K.</author><author>Karl, Jason W.</author><author>Duniway, Michael</author><author>Elaksher, Ahmed</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeling vegetation heights from high resolution stereo aerial photography: An application for broad-scale rangeland monitoring</title><secondary-title>Journal of Environmental Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Environmental Management</full-title></periodical><pages>226-235</pages><volume>144</volume><keywords><keyword>Remote sensing</keyword><keyword>Digital terrain model</keyword><keyword>Photogrammetry</keyword><keyword>Rangeland monitoring</keyword><keyword>Vegetation height</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0301-4797</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jenvman.2014.05.028</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Vertical vegetation structure in rangeland ecosystems can be a valuable indicator for assessing rangeland health and monitoring riparian areas, post-fire recovery, available forage for livestock, and wildlife habitat. Federal land management agencies are directed to monitor and manage rangelands at landscapes scales, but traditional field methods for measuring vegetation heights are often too costly and time consuming to apply at these broad scales. Most emerging remote sensing techniques capable of measuring surface and vegetation height (e.g., LiDAR or synthetic aperture radar) are often too expensive, and require specialized sensors. An alternative remote sensing approach that is potentially more practical for managers is to measure vegetation heights from digital stereo aerial photographs. As aerial photography is already commonly used for rangeland monitoring, acquiring it in stereo enables three-dimensional modeling and estimation of vegetation height. The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility and accuracy of estimating shrub heights from high-resolution (HR, 3-cm ground sampling distance) digital stereo-pair aerial images. Overlapping HR imagery was taken in March 2009 near Lake Mead, Nevada and 5-cm resolution digital surface models (DSMs) were created by photogrammetric methods (aerial triangulation, digital image matching) for twenty-six test plots. We compared the heights of individual shrubs and plot averages derived from the DSMs to field measurements. We found strong positive correlations between field and image measurements for several metrics. Individual shrub heights tended to be underestimated in the imagery, however, accuracy was higher for dense, compact shrubs compared with shrubs with thin branches. Plot averages of shrub height from DSMs were also strongly correlated to field measurements but consistently underestimated. Grasses and forbs were generally too small to be detected with the resolution of the DSMs. Estimates of vertical structure will be more accurate in plots having low herbaceous cover and high amounts of dense shrubs. Through the use of statistically derived correction factors or choosing field methods that better correlate with the imagery, vegetation heights from HR DSMs could be a valuable technique for broad-scale rangeland monitoring needs. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70115119</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jones, Lisa C.</author><author>Schwinning, Susanne</author><author>Esque, Todd C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Seedling ecology and restoration of blackbrush (Coleogyne ramosissima) in the mojave desert, United States</title><secondary-title>Restoration Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Restoration Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>692-700</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Climate change</keyword><keyword>Disturbance</keyword><keyword>Nurse plants</keyword><keyword>Seed bank</keyword><keyword>Elevation gradient</keyword><keyword>Rodents</keyword><keyword>Seed balls</keyword><keyword>Stress gradient</keyword><keyword>Survivorship</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1061-2971</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/rec.12128</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Increases in fire frequency are disrupting many ecological communities not historically subjected to fire. In the southwestern United States, the blackbrush (Coleogyne ramosissima) community is among the most threatened, often replaced by invasive annual grasses after fire. This long-lived shrub is vulnerable because it recruits sporadically, partially due to mast seeding and the absence of a seed bank. The goal of this study was to evaluate if shrub restoration can be enhanced by identifying and ameliorating recruitment limitations. Specifically, we tested the effect of encapsulating seeds in predation-deterring "seed balls." We also tested the effects of nurse plants and mammalian exclusion cages on seedling emergence, growth, and survivorship. These experiments were conducted in a full-factorial design across three sites differing in elevation. Over 2 years, 13% of all planted seeds emerged and the effect of seed balls was overwhelmingly negative because of low emergence. Nurse plants had overall positive effects at Low Elevation, but negative effects at Mid- and High Elevation. Emergence and survival were highest in caged plots everywhere, and effect sizes increased with elevation. Interactions between the cage and the nurse plant treatments indicated that nurse plants tended to attract mammalian predators, lowering emergence and seedling survivorship, particularly at higher elevations. Findings conform to the stress-gradient hypothesis in that interactions among seedlings and mature plants shifted from facilitation to competition as environmental stress decreased with increasing elevation, suggesting that they are transferable to ecologically similar communities elsewhere. Knowledge of site-specific recruitment limitations can help minimize ineffective restoration efforts.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70123999</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Syphard, Alexandra D.</author><author>Brennan, Teresa J.</author><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The role of defensible space for residential structure protection during wildfires</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</full-title></periodical><pages>1165-1175</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>8</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1049-8001</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1071/WF13158</electronic-resource-num><abstract>With the potential for worsening fire conditions, discussion is escalating over how to best reduce effects on urban communities. A widely supported strategy is the creation of defensible space immediately surrounding homes and other structures. Although state and local governments publish specific guidelines and requirements, there is little empirical evidence to suggest how much vegetation modification is needed to provide significant benefits. We analysed the role of defensible space by mapping and measuring a suite of variables on modern pre-fire aerial photography for 1000 destroyed and 1000 surviving structures for all fires where homes burned from 2001 to 2010 in San Diego County, CA, USA. Structures were more likely to survive a fire with defensible space immediately adjacent to them. The most effective treatment distance varied between 5 and 20 m (16–58 ft) from the structure, but distances larger than 30 m (100 ft) did not provide additional protection, even for structures located on steep slopes. The most effective actions were reducing woody cover up to 40% immediately adjacent to structures and ensuring that vegetation does not overhang or touch the structure. Multiple-regression models showed landscape-scale factors, including low housing density and distances to major roads, were more important in explaining structure destruction. The best long-term solution will involve a suite of prevention measures that include defensible space as well as building design approach, community education and proactive land use planning that limits exposure to fire.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70141773</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hatten, James R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mapping and monitoring Mount Graham red squirrel habitat with Lidar and Landsat imagery</title><secondary-title>Ecological Modelling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Modelling</full-title></periodical><pages>106-123</pages><volume>289</volume><keywords><keyword>Population dynamics</keyword><keyword>Endangered</keyword><keyword>Endemic</keyword><keyword>GIS</keyword><keyword>Habitat suitability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0304-3800</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2014.07.004</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Mount Graham red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus grahamensis) is an endemic subspecies located in the Pinaleño Mountains of southeast Arizona. Living in a conifer forest on a sky-island surrounded by desert, the Mount Graham red squirrel is one of the rarest mammals in North America. Over the last two decades, drought, insect infestations, and fire destroyed much of its habitat. A federal recovery team is working on a plan to recover the squirrel and detailed information is necessary on its habitat requirements and population dynamics. Toward that goal I developed and compared three probabilistic models of Mount Graham red squirrel habitat with a geographic information system and logistic regression. Each model contained the same topographic variables (slope, aspect, elevation), but the Landsat model contained a greenness variable (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) extracted from Landsat, the Lidar model contained three forest-inventory variables extracted from lidar, while the Hybrid model contained Landsat and lidar variables. The Hybrid model produced the best habitat classification accuracy, followed by the Landsat and Lidar models, respectively. Landsat-derived forest greenness was the best predictor of habitat, followed by topographic (elevation, slope, aspect) and lidar (tree height, canopy bulk density, and live basal area) variables, respectively. The Landsat model's probabilities were significantly correlated with all 12 lidar variables, indicating its utility for habitat mapping. While the Hybrid model produced the best classification results, only the Landsat model was suitable for creating a habitat time series or habitat-population function between 1986 and 2013. The techniques I highlight should prove valuable in the development of Landsat- or lidar-based habitat models range wide. © 2014.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70119003</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kane, Van R.</author><author>North, Malcolm P.</author><author>Lutz, James A.</author><author>Churchill, Derek J.</author><author>Roberts, Susan L.</author><author>Smith, Douglas F.</author><author>McGaughey, Robert J.</author><author>Kane, Jonathan T.</author><author>Brooks, Matthew L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessing fire effects on forest spatial structure using a fusion of landsat and airborne LiDAR data in Yosemite national park</title><secondary-title>Remote Sensing of Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Remote Sensing of Environment</full-title></periodical><pages>89-101</pages><volume>151</volume><keywords><keyword>Fire severity</keyword><keyword>Sierra Nevada</keyword><keyword>Abies concolor</keyword><keyword>Abies magnifica</keyword><keyword>Forest structure</keyword><keyword>Gaps</keyword><keyword>LiDAR</keyword><keyword>Pinus ponderosa</keyword><keyword>Pinus lambertiana</keyword><keyword>Relativized differenced Normalized burn ratio (RdN</keyword><keyword>Tree clumps</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0034-4257</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.rse.2013.07.041</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Mosaics of tree clumps and openings are characteristic of forests dominated by frequent, low- and moderate-severity fires. When restoring these fire-suppressed forests, managers often try to reproduce these structures to increase ecosystem resilience. We examined unburned and burned forest structures for 1937 0.81. ha sample areas in Yosemite National Park, USA. We estimated severity for fires from 1984 to 2010 using the Landsat-derived Relativized differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR) and measured openings and canopy clumps in five height strata using airborne LiDAR data. Because our study area lacked concurrent field data, we identified methods to allow structural analysis using LiDAR data alone. We found three spatial structures, canopy-gap, clump-open, and open, that differed in spatial arrangement and proportion of canopy and openings. As fire severity increased, the total area in canopy decreased while the number of clumps increased, creating a patchwork of openings and multistory tree clumps. The presence of openings &gt;. 0.3. ha, an approximate minimum gap size needed to favor shade-intolerant pine regeneration, increased rapidly with loss of canopy area. The range and variation of structures for a given fire severity were specific to each forest type. Low- to moderate-severity fires best replicated the historic clump-opening patterns that were common in forests with frequent fire regimes. Our results suggest that managers consider the following goals for their forest restoration: 1) reduce total canopy cover by breaking up large contiguous areas into variable-sized tree clumps and scattered large individual trees; 2) create a range of opening sizes and shapes, including ~. 50% of the open area in gaps &gt;. 0.3. ha; 3) create multistory clumps in addition to single story clumps; 4) retain historic densities of large trees; and 5) vary treatments to include canopy-gap, clump-open, and open mosaics across project areas to mimic the range of patterns found for each forest type in our study. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70123861</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shryock, Daniel F.</author><author>Defalco, Lesley A.</author><author>Esque, Todd C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Life-history traits predict perennial species response to fire in a desert ecosystem</title><secondary-title>Ecology and Evolution</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecology and Evolution</full-title></periodical><pages>3046-3059</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>15</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire</keyword><keyword>Mojave Desert</keyword><keyword>Plant functional types</keyword><keyword>Trait analysis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2045-7758 (Electronic)\r2045-7758 (Linking)</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/ece3.1159</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Mojave Desert of North America has become fire-prone in recent decades due to invasive annual grasses that fuel wildfires following years of high rainfall. Perennial species are poorly adapted to fire in this system, and post-fire shifts in species composition have been substantial but variable across community types. To generalize across a range of conditions, we investigated whether simple life-history traits could predict how species responded to fire. Further, we classified species into plant functional types (PFTs) based on combinations of life-history traits and evaluated whether these groups exhibited a consistent fire-response. Six life-history traits varied significantly between burned and unburned areas in short (up to 4 years) or long-term (up to 52 years) post-fire datasets, including growth form, lifespan, seed size, seed dispersal, height, and leaf longevity. Forbs and grasses consistently increased in abundance after fire, while cacti were reduced and woody species exhibited a variable response. Woody species were classified into three PFTs based on combinations of life-history traits. Species in Group 1 increased in abundance after fire and were characterized by short lifespans, small, wind-dispersed seeds, low height, and deciduous leaves. Species in Group 2 were reduced by fire and distinguished from Group 1 by longer lifespans and evergreen leaves. Group 3 species, which also decreased after fire, were characterized by long lifespans, large non-wind dispersed seeds, and taller heights. Our results show that PFTs based on life-history traits can reliably predict the responses of most species to fire in the Mojave Desert. Dominant, long-lived species of this region possess a combination of traits limiting their ability to recover, presenting a clear example of how a novel disturbance regime may shift selective environmental pressures to favor alternative life-history strategies.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70124040</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Manies, Kristen L</author><author>Harden, Jennifer W</author><author>Holingsworth, Teresa N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Soils, vegetation, and woody debris data from the 2001 Survey Line fire and a comparable unburned site, Tanana Flats region, Alaska</title></titles><pages>25-25</pages><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2014-1049</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20141049</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Karl, Jason W.</author><author>Gillan, Jeffrey K.</author><author>Barger, Nichole N.</author><author>Herrick, Jeffrey E.</author><author>Duniway, Michael C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interpretation of high-resolution imagery for detecting vegetation cover composition change after fuels reduction treatments in woodlands</title><secondary-title>Ecological Indicators</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Indicators</full-title></periodical><pages>570-578</pages><volume>45</volume><keywords><keyword>Land cover</keyword><keyword>Remote sensing</keyword><keyword>Change detection</keyword><keyword>Rangeland monitoring</keyword><keyword>High-resolution</keyword><keyword>Image interpretation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1470-160X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.05.017</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The use of very high resolution (VHR; ground sampling distances &lt; ∼5 cm) aerial imagery to estimate site vegetation cover and to detect changes from management has been well documented. However, as the purpose of monitoring is to document change over time, the ability to detect changes from imagery at the same or better level of accuracy and precision as those measured in situ must be assessed for image-based techniques to become reliable tools for ecosystem monitoring. Our objective with this study was to quantify the relationship between field-measured and image-interpreted changes in vegetation and ground cover measured one year apart in a Piñon and Juniper (P-J) woodland in southern Utah, USA. The study area was subject to a variety of fuel removal treatments between 2009 and 2010. We measured changes in plant community composition and ground cover along transects in a control area and three different treatments prior to and following P-J removal. We compared these measurements to vegetation composition and change based on photo-interpretation of ∼4 cm ground sampling distance imagery along similar transects. Estimates of cover were similar between field-based and image-interpreted methods in 2009 and 2010 for woody vegetation, no vegetation, herbaceous vegetation, and litter (including woody litter). Image-interpretation slightly overestimated cover for woody vegetation and no-vegetation classes (average difference between methods of 1.34% and 5.85%) and tended to underestimate cover for herbaceous vegetation and litter (average difference of -5.18% and 0.27%), but the differences were significant only for litter cover in 2009. Level of agreement between the field-measurements and image-interpretation was good for woody vegetation and no-vegetation classes (r between 0.47 and 0.89), but generally poorer for herbaceous vegetation and litter (r between 0.18 and 0.81) likely due to differences in image quality by year and the difficulty in discriminating fine vegetation and litter in imagery. Our results show that image interpretation to detect vegetation changes has utility for monitoring fuels reduction treatments in terms of woody vegetation and no-vegetation classes. The benefits of this technique are that it provides objective and repeatable measurements of site conditions that could be implemented relatively inexpensively and easily without the need for highly specialized software or technical expertise. Perhaps the biggest limitations of image interpretation to monitoring fuels treatments are challenges in estimating litter and herbaceous vegetation cover and the sensitivity of herbaceous cover estimates to image quality and shadowing. © Published by Elsevier Ltd.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70114455</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pausas, Juli G.</author><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evolutionary ecology of resprouting and seeding in fire-prone ecosystems</title><secondary-title>New Phytologist</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>New Phytologist</full-title></periodical><pages>55-65</pages><volume>204</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire ecology</keyword><keyword>Resprouting</keyword><keyword>Seeding</keyword><keyword>Iteroparity</keyword><keyword>Monopyric</keyword><keyword>Polypyric</keyword><keyword>Semeplarity</keyword><keyword>Trait evolution</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2150-8925</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/nph.12921</electronic-resource-num><abstract>There are two broad mechanisms by which plant populations persist under recurrent disturbances: resprouting from surviving tissues, and seedling recruitment. Species can have one of these mechanisms or both. However, a coherent framework explaining the differential evolutionary pressures driving these regeneration mechanisms is lacking.Wepropose a bottom- up approach in addressing this question that considers the relative survivorship of adults and juveniles in an evolutionary context, based on two assumptions. First, resprouting and seeding can be interpreted by analogy with annual versus perennial life histories; that is, if we consider disturbance cycles to be analogous to annual cycles, then resprouting species are analogous to the perennial life history with iteroparous reproduction,andobligate seeding species that survive disturbances solely through seed banks are analogous to the annual life history with semelparous reproduction. Secondly, changes in the selective regimes differentially modify the survival rates of adultsandjuveniles andthus the relative costsandbenefits of resprouting versus seeding.Our approach provides a framework for understanding temporal and spatial variation in resprouting and seeding under crown-fire regimes. It accounts for patterns of coexistence and environ- mental changes that contribute to the evolution of seeding from resprouting ancestors.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70124264</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Staley, Dennis M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Emergency assessment of post-fire debris-flow hazards for the 2013 Springs Fire, Ventura County, California</title></titles><pages>14-14</pages><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2014-1001</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20141001</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Weyenberg, Scott A.</author><author>Pavlovic, Noel B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vegetation Dynamics After Spring and Summer Fires in Red and White Pine Stands at Voyageurs National Park</title><secondary-title>Natural Areas Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Natural Areas Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>443-458</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3375/043.034.0406</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Conducting dormant season or springtime prescribed fire treatments has&#xD;become a common practice in many regions of the United States to restore&#xD;ecosystems to their natural state.

However, forecasting future climatic change induced impacts on fire regimes will require a clearer understanding of other drivers of abrupt fire regime changes. Here, we focus on evidence from different environmental and temporal settings of fire regimes changes that are not directly attributed to climatic changes. We review key cases of these abrupt fire regime changes at different spatial and temporal scales, including those directly driven (i) by fauna, (ii) by invasive plant species, and (iii) by socio-economic and policy changes. All these drivers might generate non-linear effects of landscape changes in fuel structure; that is, they generate fuel changes that can cross thresholds of landscape continuity, and thus drastically change fire activity. Although climatic changes might contribute to some of these changes, there are also many instances that are not primarily linked to climatic shifts. Understanding the mechanism driving fire regime changes should contribute to our ability to better assess future fire regimes.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70124267</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bradford, John B.</author><author>Schlaepfer, Daniel R.</author><author>Lauenroth, William K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ecohydrology of Adjacent Sagebrush and Lodgepole Pine Ecosystems: The Consequences of Climate Change and Disturbance</title><secondary-title>Ecosystems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecosystems</full-title></periodical><pages>590-605</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Pinus contorta</keyword><keyword>bark beetles</keyword><keyword>wildfire</keyword><keyword>Artemisia tridentata</keyword><keyword>plant-climate interactions</keyword><keyword>plant-soil interactions</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1432-9840</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10021-013-9745-1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Sagebrush steppe and lodgepole pine forests are two of the most widespread vegetation types in the western United States and they play crucial roles in the hydrologic cycle of these water-limited regions. We used a process-based ecosystem water model to characterize the potential impact of climate change and disturbance (wildfire and beetle mortality) on water cycling in adjacent sagebrush and lodgepole pine ecosystems. Despite similar climatic and topographic conditions between these ecosystems at the sites examined, lodgepole pine, and sagebrush exhibited consistent differences in water balance, notably more evaporation and drier summer soils in the sagebrush and greater transpiration and less water yield in lodgepole pine. Canopy disturbances (either fire or beetle) have dramatic impacts on water balance and availability: reducing transpiration while increasing evaporation and water yield. Results suggest that climate change may reduce snowpack, increase evaporation and transpiration, and lengthen the duration of dry soil conditions in the summer, but may have uncertain effects on drainage. Changes in the distribution of sagebrush and lodgepole pine ecosystems as a consequence of climate change and/or altered disturbance regimes will likely alter ecosystem water balance.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70110938</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Willey, David W.</author><author>Van Riper, Charles</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Home range characteristics of Mexican Spotted Owls in the Rincon Mountains, Arizona</title><secondary-title>The Wilson Journal of Ornithology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Wilson Journal of Ornithology</full-title></periodical><pages>53-59</pages><volume>126</volume><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1676/13-029.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We studied a small isolated population of Mexican Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis lucida) from 1996–1997 in the Rincon Mountains of Saguaro National Park, southeastern Arizona, USA.

Using radio-telemetry, we examined owl home range characteristics, roost habitat, and monitored reproduction within these five territories. Breeding season (Mar–Sep) home range size for 10 adult owls (95% adaptive kernel isopleths) averaged 267 ha (±207 SD), and varied widely among owls (range 34–652 ha). Mean home range size for owl pairs was 478 ha (±417 ha SD), and ranged from 70–1,160 ha. Owls that produced young used smaller home ranges than owls that had no young. Six habitat variables differed significantly between roost and random sites, including: percent canopy cover, number of trees, number of vegetation layers, average height of trees, average diameter of trees, and tree basal area. Radio-marked owls remained in their territories following small prescribed management fires within those territories, exhibiting no proximate effects to the presence of prescribed fire.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1676/13-029.1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hayes, Daniel J.</author><author>Kicklighter, David W.</author><author>McGuire, A.

As the northern permafrost region experiences as much as a doubling of the rate of warming as the rest of the Earth, the vast amount of C in permafrost soils is vulnerable to thaw, decomposition and release as atmospheric greenhouse gases. Diagnostic and predictive estimates of high-latitude terrestrial C fluxes vary widely among different models depending on how dynamics in permafrost, and the seasonally thawed ‘active layer’ above it, are represented. Here, we employ a process-based model simulation experiment to assess the net effect of active layer dynamics on this ‘permafrost carbon feedback’ in recent decades, from 1970 to 2006, over the circumpolar domain of continuous and discontinuous permafrost. Over this time period, the model estimates a mean increase of 6.8 cm in active layer thickness across the domain, which exposes a total of 11.6 Pg C of thawed SOM to decomposition. According to our simulation experiment, mobilization of this previously frozen C results in an estimated cumulative net source of 3.7 Pg C to the atmosphere since 1970 directly tied to active layer dynamics. Enhanced decomposition from the newly exposed SOM accounts for the release of both CO2 (4.0 Pg C) and CH4 (0.03 Pg C), but is partially compensated by CO2 uptake (0.3 Pg C) associated with enhanced net primary production of vegetation. This estimated net C transfer to the atmosphere from permafrost thaw represents a significant factor in the overall ecosystem carbon budget of the Pan-Arctic, and a non-trivial additional contribution on top of the combined fossil fuel emissions from the eight Arctic nations over this time period</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70168817</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hurteau, Matthew D.</author><author>Bradford, John B.</author><author>Ful??, Peter Z.</author><author>Taylor, Alan H.</author><author>Martin, Katherine L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Climate change, fire management, and ecological services in the southwestern US</title><secondary-title>Forest Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forest Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>280-289</pages><volume>327</volume><keywords><keyword>Biodiversity</keyword><keyword>Carbon</keyword><keyword>Mitigation</keyword><keyword>Adaptation</keyword><keyword>Emissions</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0378-1127</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.foreco.2013.08.007</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The diverse forest types of the southwestern US are inseparable from fire. Across climate zones in California, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico, fire suppression has left many forest types out of sync with their historic fire regimes. As a result, high fuel loads place them at risk of severe fire, particularly as fire activity increases due to climate change. A legacy of fire exclusion coupled with a warming climate has led to increasingly large and severe wildfires in many southwest forest types. Climate change projections include an extended fire season length due to earlier snowmelt and a general drying trend due to rising temperatures. This suggests the future will be warmer and drier regardless of changes in precipitation. Hotter, drier conditions are likely to increase forest flammability, at least initially. Changes in climate alone have the potential to alter the distribution of vegetation types within the region, and climate-driven shifts in vegetation distribution are likely to be accelerated when coupled with stand-replacing fire. Regardless of the rate of change, the interaction of climate and fire and their effects on Southwest ecosystems will alter the provisioning of ecosystem services, including carbon storage and biodiversity. Interactions between climate, fire, and vegetation growth provide a source of great uncertainty in projecting future fire activity in the region, as post-fire forest recovery is strongly influenced by climate and subsequent fire frequency. Severe fire can be mitigated with fuels management including prescribed fire, thinning, and wildfire management, but new strategies are needed to ensure the effectiveness of treatments across landscapes. We review the current understanding of the relationship between fire and climate in the Southwest, both historical and projected. We then discuss the potential implications of climate change for fire management and examine the potential effects of climate change and fire on ecosystem services. We conclude with an assessment of the role of fire management in an increasingly flammable Southwest. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70048145</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gunther, Kerry A.</author><author>Shoemaker, Rebecca R.</author><author>Frey, Kevin L.</author><author>Haroldson, Mark A.</author><author>Cain, Steven L.</author><author>van Manen, Frank T.</author><author>Fortin, Jennifer K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dietary breadth of grizzly bears in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem</title><secondary-title>Ursus</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ursus</full-title></periodical><pages>60-72</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1537-6176</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2192/URSUS-D-13-00008.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>BioOne (www.bioone.org) is a nonprofit, online aggregation of core research in the biological, ecological, and environmental sciences.

Abstract: Grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) are opportunistic omnivores that eat a great diversity of plant and animal species. Changes in climate may affect regional vegetation, hydrology, insects, and fire regimes, likely influencing the abundance, range, and elevational distribution of the plants and animals consumed by GYE grizzly bears. Determining the dietary breadth of grizzly bears is important to document future changes in food resources and how those changes may affect the nutritional ecology of grizzlies. However, no synthesis exists of all foods consumed by grizzly bears in the GYE. We conducted a review of available literature and compiled a list of species consumed by grizzly bears in the GYE. We documented .266 species within 200 genera from 4 kingdoms, including 175 plant, 37 invertebrate, 34 mammal, 7 fungi, 7 bird, 4 fish, 1 amphibian, and 1 algae species as well as 1 soil type consumed by grizzly bears. The average energy values of the ungulates (6.8 kcal/g), trout (Oncorhynchus spp., 6.1 kcal/g), and small mammals (4.5 kcal/g) eaten by grizzlies were higher than those of the plants (3.0 kcal/g) and invertebrates (2.7 kcal/g) they consumed. The most frequently detected diet items were graminoids, ants (Formicidae), whitebark pine seeds (Pinus albicaulis), clover (Trifolium spp.), and dandelion (Taraxacum spp.). The most consistently used foods on a temporal basis were graminoids, ants, whitebark pine seeds, clover, elk (Cervus elaphus), thistle (Cirsium spp.), and horsetail (Equisetum spp.). Historically, garbage was a significant diet item for grizzlies until refuse dumps were closed. Use of forbs increased after garbage was no longer readily available. The list of foods we compiled will help managers of grizzly bears and their habitat document future changes in grizzly bear food habits and how bears respond to changing food resources.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.2192/URSUS-D-13-00008.1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Knick, Steven T.</author><author>Hanser, Steven E.</author><author>Leu, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ecological Scale of Bird Community Response to Piñon-Juniper Removal</title><secondary-title>Rangeland Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Rangeland Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>553-562</pages><volume>67</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Prescribed fire</keyword><keyword>Bird community</keyword><keyword>Ecological scale</keyword><keyword>Ordination</keyword><keyword>Sagebrush-obligate birds</keyword><keyword>Woodland-sagebrush ecotone</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1550-7424</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2111/REM-D-13-00023.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Piñon (Pinus spp.) and juniper (Juniperus spp.) removal is a common management approach to restore sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) vegetation in areas experiencing woodland expansion. Because many management treatments are conducted to benefit sagebrush-obligate birds, we surveyed bird communities to assess treatment effectiveness in establishing sagebrush bird communities at study sites in Utah, Nevada, Idaho, and Oregon. Our analyses included data from 1 or 2 yr prior to prescribed fire or mechanical treatment and 3 to 5 yr posttreatment. We used detrended correspondence analysis to 1) identify primary patterns of bird communities surveyed from 2006 to 2011 at point transects, 2) estimate ecological scale of change needed to achieve treatment objectives from the relative dissimilarity of survey points to the ordination region delineating sagebrush bird communities, and 3) measure changes in pre- and posttreatment bird communities. Birds associated with sagebrush, woodlands, and ecotones were detected on our surveys; increased dissimilarity of survey points to the sagebrush bird community was characterized by a gradient of increased juniper and decreased sagebrush cover. Prescribed fires burned between 30% and 97% of our bird survey points. However, from 6% to 24% cover of piñon-juniper still remained posttreatment on the four treatment plots. We measured only slight changes in bird communities, which responded primarily to current vegetation rather than relative amount of change from pretreatment vegetation structure. Bird communities at survey points located at greater ecological scales from the sagebrush bird community changed least and will require more significant impact to achieve changes. Sagebrush bird communities were established at only two survey points, which were adjacent to a larger sagebrush landscape and following almost complete juniper removal by mechanical treatment. Our results indicate that management treatments that leave residual woodland cover and are not adjacent to extensive sagebrush stands are unlikely to establish sagebrush birds.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70128746</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Lin</author><author>Jafarov, Elchin E.</author><author>Schaefer, Kevin M.</author><author>Jones, Benjamin M.</author><author>Zebker, Howard A.</author><author>Williams, Christopher A.</author><author>Rogan, John</author><author>Zhang, Tingjun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>InSAR detects increase in surface subsidence caused by an Arctic tundra fire</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>3906-3913</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>permafrost</keyword><keyword>Arctic</keyword><keyword>wildfire</keyword><keyword>tundra</keyword><keyword>remote sensing</keyword><keyword>subsidence</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1944-8007</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2014GL060533</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Wildfire is a major disturbance in the Arctic tundra and boreal forests, having a significant impact on soil hydrology, carbon cycling, and permafrost dynamics. This study explores the use of the microwave Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique to map and quantify ground surface subsidence caused by the Anaktuvuk River fire on the North Slope of Alaska. We detected an increase of up to 8 cm of thaw-season ground subsidence after the fire, which is due to a combination of thickened active layer and permafrost thaw subsidence. Our results illustrate the effectiveness and potential of using InSAR to quantify fire impacts on the Arctic tundra, especially in regions underlain by ice-rich permafrost.

We identified six Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis Beetle &amp; Young) locations (152-381 mm precipitation) that we believed had sufficient resilience and resistance for recovery. We examined impacts of woody fuel reduction (fire, mowing, the herbicide tebuthiuron, and untreated controls, all with and without the herbicide imazapic) on short-term dominance of plant groups and on important land health parameters with the use of analysis of variance (ANOVA). Fire and mowing reduced woody biomass at least 85% for 3 yr, but herbaceous fuels were reduced only by fire (72%) and only in the first year. Herbaceous fuels produced at least 36% more biomass with mowing than untreated areas during posttreatment years. Imazapic only reduced herbaceous biomass after fires (34%). Tebuthiuron never affected herbaceous biomass. Perennial tall grass cover was reduced by 59% relative to untreated controls in the first year after fire, but it recovered by the second year. Cover of all remaining herbaceous groups was not changed by woody fuel treatments. Only imazapic reduced significantly herbaceous cover. Cheatgrass cover was reduced at least 63% with imazapic for 3 yr. Imazapic reduced annual forb cover by at least 45%, and unexpectedly, perennial grass cover by 49% (combination of tall grasses and Sandberg bluegrass [Poa secunda J. Presl.]). Fire reduced density of Sandberg bluegrass between 40% and 58%, decreased lichen and moss cover between 69% and 80%, and consequently increased bare ground between 21% and 34% and proportion of gaps among perennial plants &gt;2 m (at least 28% during the 3 yr). Fire, mowing, and imazapic may be effective in reducing fuels for 3 yr, but each has potentially undesirable consequences on plant communities.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70128738</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Knutson, Kevin C.</author><author>Pyke, David A.</author><author>Wirth, Troy A.</author><author>Arkle, Robert S.</author><author>Pilliod, David S.</author><author>Brooks, Matthew L.</author><author>Chambers, Jeanne C.</author><author>Grace, James B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Long-term effects of seeding after wildfire on vegetation in Great Basin shrubland ecosystems</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>1414-1424</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Bromus</keyword><keyword>Restoration</keyword><keyword>Semi-arid</keyword><keyword>Cheatgrass</keyword><keyword>Sagebrush</keyword><keyword>Artemisia tridentata</keyword><keyword>Aerial seeding</keyword><keyword>Drill seeding</keyword><keyword>Exotic annuals</keyword><keyword>Non-native annuals</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0021-8901</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/1365-2664.12309</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Invasive annual grasses alter fire regimes in shrubland ecosystems of the western USA, threatening ecosystem function and fragmenting habitats necessary for shrub-obligate species such as greater sage-grouse. Post-fire stabilization and rehabilitation treatments have been administered to stabilize soils, reduce invasive species spread and restore or establish sustainable ecosystems in which native species are well represented. Long-term effectiveness of these treatments has rarely been evaluated. We studied vegetation at 88 sites where aerial or drill seeding was implemented following fires between 1990 and 2003 in Great Basin (USA) shrublands. We examined sites on loamy soils that burned only once since 1970 to eliminate confounding effects of recurrent fire and to assess soils most conducive to establishment of seeded species. We evaluated whether seeding provided greater cover of perennial seeded species than burned-unseeded and unburned-unseeded sites, while also accounting for environmental variation. Post-fire seeding of native perennial grasses generally did not increase cover relative to burned-unseeded areas. Native perennial grass cover did, however, increase after drill seeding when competitive non-natives were not included in mixes. Seeding non-native perennial grasses and the shrub Bassia prostrata resulted in more vegetative cover in aerial and drill seeding, with non-native perennial grass cover increasing with annual precipitation. Seeding native shrubs, particularly Artemisia tridentata, did not increase shrub cover or density in burned areas. Cover of undesirable, non-native annual grasses was lower in drill seeded relative to unseeded areas, but only at higher elevations. Synthesis and applications.

The characterization of direct, fine-scale processes affecting animals is potentially valuable for management applications, but these are difficult to quantify over broad extents. Direct predictors are also expected to improve transferability of models beyond the area of study. Here, we investigated the ability of non-static and multi-temporal habitat characteristics to predict marsh bird distributions, while testing model generality and transferability between two coastal habitats. Distribution models were developed for king rail (Rallus elegans), common gallinule (Gallinula galeata), least bittern (Ixobrychus exilis), and purple gallinule (Porphyrio martinica) in fresh and intermediate marsh types in the northern Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Texas, USA. For model development, repeated point count surveys of marsh birds were conducted from 2009 to 2011. Landsat satellite imagery was used to quantify both annual conditions and cumulative, multi-temporal habitat characteristics. We used multivariate adaptive regression splines to quantify bird-habitat relationships for fresh, intermediate, and combined marsh habitats. Multi-temporal habitat characteristics ranked as more important than single-date characteristics, as temporary water was most influential in six of eight models. Predictive power was greater for marsh type-specific models compared to general models and model transferability was poor. Birds in fresh marsh selected for annual habitat characterizations, while birds in intermediate marsh selected for cumulative wetness and heterogeneity. Our findings emphasize that dynamic ecological processes can affect species distribution and species-habitat relationships may differ with dominant landscape characteristics. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70148178</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Picotte, Joshua J</author><author>Coan, Michael</author><author>Howard, Stephen M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Use of multi-sensor active fire detections to map fires in the United States: the future of monitoring trends in burn severity</title></titles><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70100631</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Arkle, Robert S.</author><author>Pilliod, David S.</author><author>Hanser, Steven E.</author><author>Brooks, Matthew L.</author><author>Chambers, Jeanne C.</author><author>Grace, James B.</author><author>Knutson, Kevin C.</author><author>Pyke, David A.</author><author>Welty, Justin L.</author><author>Wirth, Troy A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantifying restoration effectiveness using multi-scale habitat models: Implications for sage-grouse in the Great Basin</title><secondary-title>Ecosphere</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecosphere</full-title></periodical><volume>5</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Western USA</keyword><keyword>Sagebrush</keyword><keyword>Artemisia tridentata</keyword><keyword>Centrocercus urophasianus</keyword><keyword>Greater Sage-Grouse</keyword><keyword>Habitat management guideline</keyword><keyword>Landscape</keyword><keyword>Occupancy model</keyword><keyword>Rangeland restoration</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2150-8925</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1890/ES13-00278.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A recurrent challenge in the conservation of wide-ranging, imperiled species is understanding which habitats to protect and whether we are capable of restoring degraded landscapes. For Greater Sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), a species of conservation concern in the western United States, we approached this problem by developing multi-scale empirical models of occupancy in 211 randomly located plots within a 40 million ha portion of the species’ range. We then used these models to predict sage-grouse habitat quality at 826 plots associated with 101 post-wildfire seeding projects implemented from 1990 to 2003. We also compared conditions at restoration sites to published habitat guidelines. Sage-grouse occupancy was positively related to plot- and landscape-level dwarf sagebrush (Artemisia arbuscula, A. nova, A. tripartita) and big sagebrush steppe prevalence, and negatively associated with non-native plants and human development. The predicted probability of sage-grouse occupancy at treated plots was low on average (0.09) and not substantially different from burned areas that had not been treated. Restoration sites with quality habitat tended to occur at higher elevation locations with low annual temperatures, high spring precipitation, and high plant diversity. Of 313 plots seeded after fire, none met all sagebrush guidelines for breeding habitats, but approximately 50% met understory guidelines, particularly for perennial grasses. This pattern was similar for summer habitat. Less than 2% of treated plots met winter habitat guidelines. Restoration actions did not increase the probability of burned areas meeting most guideline criteria. The probability of meeting guidelines was influenced by a latitudinal gradient, climate, and topography. Our results suggest that sage-grouse are relatively unlikely to use many burned areas within 20 years of fire, regardless of treatment. Understory habitat conditions are more likely to be adequate than overstory conditions, but in most climates, establishing forbs and reducing cheatgrass dominance is unlikely. Reestablishing sagebrush cover will require more than 20 years using past restoration methods. Given current fire frequencies and restoration capabilities, protection of landscapes containing a mix of dwarf sagebrush and big sagebrush steppe, minimal human development, and low non-native plant cover may provide the best opportunity for conservation of sage-grouse habitats.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70099347</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stephens, Scott L.</author><author>Burrows, Neil</author><author>Buyantuyev, Alexander</author><author>Gray, Robert W.</author><author>Keane, Robert E.</author><author>Kubian, Rick</author><author>Liu, Shirong</author><author>Seijo, Francisco</author><author>Shu, Lifu</author><author>Tolhurst, Kevin G.</author><author>Van Wagtendonk, Jan W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Temperate and boreal forest mega-fires: Characteristics and challenges</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment</full-title></periodical><pages>115-122</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1540-9295</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1890/120332</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Mega-fires are often defined according to their size and intensity but are more accurately described by their socio- economic impacts. Three factors – climate change, fire exclusion, and antecedent disturbance, collectively referred to as the “mega-fire triangle” – likely contribute to today’s mega-fires. Some characteristics of mega-fires may emu- late historical fire regimes and can therefore sustain healthy fire-prone ecosystems, but other attributes decrease ecosystem resiliency. A good example of a program that seeks to mitigate mega-fires is located in Western Australia, where prescribed burning reduces wildfire intensity while conserving ecosystems. Crown-fire-adapted ecosystems are likely at higher risk of frequent mega-fires as a result of climate change, as compared with other ecosystems once subject to frequent less severe fires. Fire and forest managers should recognize that mega-fires will be a part of future wildland fire regimes and should develop strategies to reduce their undesired impacts.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70156389</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Howe, Kristy B.</author><author>Coates, Peter S.</author><author>Delehanty, David J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Selection of anthropogenic features and vegetation characteristics by nesting Common Ravens in the sagebrush ecosystem</title><secondary-title>The Condor</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Condor</full-title></periodical><pages>35-49</pages><volume>116</volume><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0010-5422</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1650/CONDOR-13-115-R2.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Common Raven (Corvus corax) numbers and distribution are increasing throughout the sagebrush steppe, influencing avian communities in complex ways. Anthropogenic structures are thought to increase raven populations by providing food and nesting subsidies, which is cause for concern because ravens are important nest predators of sensitive species, including Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). During 2007–2009, we located raven nests in southeastern Idaho and conducted a resource selection analysis. We measured variables at multiple spatial scales for 72 unique nest locations, including landscape-level vegetation characteristics and anthropogenic structures. Using generalized linear mixed models and an information-theoretic approach, we found a 31% decrease in the odds of nesting by ravens for every 1 km increase in distance away from a transmission line. Furthermore, a 100-m increase in distance away from the edge of two different land cover types decreased the odds of nesting by 20%, and an increase in the amount of edge by 1 km within an area of 102.1 ha centered on the nest increased the odds of nesting by 49%. A post hoc analysis revealed that ravens were most likely to nest near edges of adjoining big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) and land cover types that were associated with direct human disturbance or fire. These findings contribute to our understanding of raven expansion into rural environments and could be used to make better-informed conservation decisions, especially in the face of increasing renewable energy development.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.bioone.org/doi/10.1650/CONDOR-13-115-R2.1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Breininger, David</author><author>Duncan, Brean</author><author>Eaton, Mitchell</author><author>Johnson, Fred</author><author>Nichols, James</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Integrating Land Cover Modeling and Adaptive Management to Conserve Endangered Species and Reduce Catastrophic Fire Risk</title><secondary-title>Land</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Land</full-title></periodical><pages>874-897</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2073-445X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/land3030874</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Land cover modeling is used to inform land management, but most often via a two-step process, where science informs how management alternatives can influence resources, and then, decision makers can use this information to make decisions. A more efficient process is to directly integrate science and decision-making, where science allows us to learn in order to better accomplish management objectives and is developed to address specific decisions. Co-development of management and science is especially productive when decisions are complicated by multiple objectives and impeded by uncertainty. Multiple objectives can be met by the specification of tradeoffs, and relevant uncertainty can be addressed through targeted science (i.e., models and monitoring). We describe how to integrate habitat and fuel monitoring with decision-making focused on the dual objectives of managing for endangered species and minimizing catastrophic fire risk. Under certain conditions, both objectives might be achieved by a similar management policy; other conditions require tradeoffs between objectives. Knowledge about system responses to actions can be informed by developing hypotheses based on ideas about fire behavior and then applying competing management actions to different land units in the same system state. Monitoring and management integration is important to optimize state-specific management decisions and to increase knowledge about system responses. We believe this approach has broad utility and identifies a clear role for land cover modeling programs intended to inform decision-making.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/3/3/874/</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lewis, Tyler L.</author><author>Lindberg, Mark S.</author><author>Schmutz, Joel A.</author><author>Bertram, Mark R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multi-trophic resilience of boreal lake ecosystems to forest fires</title><secondary-title>Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>1253-1263</pages><volume>95</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Boreal forest</keyword><keyword>Resilience</keyword><keyword>Aquatic invertebrates</keyword><keyword>Ecological subsidy</keyword><keyword>Forest fire</keyword><keyword>Freshwater food web</keyword><keyword>Trophic ecology</keyword><keyword>Waterbirds.</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0012-9658; 1939-9170</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1890/13-1170.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fires are the major natural disturbance in the boreal forest, and their frequency and intensity will likely increase as the climate warms. Terrestrial nutrients released by fires may be transported to boreal lakes, stimulating increased primary productivity, which may radiate through multiple trophic levels. Using a before-after-control-impact (BACI) design, with pre- and postfire data from burned and unburned areas, we examined effects of a natural fire across several trophic levels of boreal lakes, from nutrient and chlorophyll levels, to macroinvertebrates, to waterbirds. Concentrations of total nitrogen and phosphorus were not affected by the fire. Chlorophyll a levels were also unaffected, likely reflecting the stable nutrient concentrations. For aquatic invertebrates, we found that densities of three functional feeding groups did not respond to the fire (filterers, gatherers, scrapers), while two groups increased (shredders, predators). Amphipods accounted for 98% of shredder numbers, and we hypothesize that fire-mediated habitat changes may have favored their generalist feeding and habitat ecology. This increase in amphipods may, in turn, have driven increased predator densities, as amphipods were the most numerous invertebrate in our lakes and are commonly taken as prey. Finally, abundance of waterbird young, which feed primarily on aquatic invertebrates, was not affected by the fire. Overall, ecosystems of our study lakes were largely resilient to forest fires, likely due to their high initial nutrient concentrations and small catchment sizes. Moreover, this resilience spanned multiple trophic levels, a significant result for ecologically similar boreal regions, especially given the high potential for increased fires with future climate change.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70134285</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tillery, Anne C</author><author>Haas, Jessica R</author><author>Miller, Lara W</author><author>Scott, Joe H</author><author>Thompson, Matthew P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Potential postwildfire debris-flow hazards: a prewildfire evaluation for the Sandia and Manzano Mountains and surrounding areas, central New Mexico</title></titles><pages>34-34</pages><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2014-5161</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20145161</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pellerin, Brian a</author><author>Bergamaschi, Brian a</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Optical Sensors for Water Quality</title><secondary-title>Lakeline</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Lakeline</full-title></periodical><pages>13-17</pages><issue>Spring</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>S hifts in land use, population, and climate have altered hydrologic systems in the United States in ways that affect water quality and ecosystem function. Water diversions, detention in reservoirs, increased channelization, and changes in rainfall and snowmelt are major causes, but there are also more subtle causes such as changes in soil temperature, atmospheric deposition, and shifting vegetation patterns. The effects on water quality are complex and interconnected, and occur at timeframes of minutes (e.g., flash floods) to decades (e.g., evolving management practices). However, water-quality monitoring has historically focused on discrete samples collected weekly or monthly, and laboratory analyses that can take days or weeks to complete. Low-frequency data and delayed access hampers a timely response during events, limits the ability to identify specific causes or actions, and may result in poorly quantified effects on ecosystems and human health at local to regional scales. Recent advancements in commercially available in situ sensors, data platforms, and new techniques for data analysis provide an opportunity to monitor water quality in rivers, lakes, and estuaries on the time scales in which changes occur. For example, measurements that capture the variability in freshwater systems over time help to assess how shifts in seasonal runoff, changes in precipitation intensity, and increased frequencies of disturbances (such as fire and insect outbreaks) affect the storage, production, and transport of carbon and nitrogen in watersheds. Transmitting these data in real-time also provides information that can be used for early trend detection, help identify monitoring gaps, and provide science-based decision support across a range of issues related to water quality, freshwater ecosystems, and human health.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70143405</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fulé, Peter Z.</author><author>Swetnam, Thomas W.</author><author>Brown, Peter M.</author><author>Falk, Donald A.</author><author>Peterson, David L.</author><author>Allen, Craig D.</author><author>Aplet, Gregory H.</author><author>Battaglia, Mike A.</author><author>Binkley, Dan</author><author>Farris, Calvin</author><author>Keane, Robert E.</author><author>Margolis, Ellis Q.</author><author>Grissino-Mayer, Henri</author><author>Miller, Carol</author><author>Sieg, Carolyn Hull</author><author>Skinner, Carl</author><author>Stephens, Scott L.</author><author>Taylor, Alan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Unsupported inferences of high-severity fire in historical dry forests of the western United States: Response to Williams and Baker</title><secondary-title>Global Ecology and Biogeography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Ecology and Biogeography</full-title></periodical><pages>825-830</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Ponderosa pine</keyword><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Fire regime</keyword><keyword>Fire severity</keyword><keyword>General Land Office survey</keyword><keyword>Historical range of variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1466-822X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/geb.12136</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Reconstructions of dry western US forests in the late 19th century in Arizona, Colorado and Oregon based on GeneralLandOffice recordswere usedby Williams &amp; Baker (2012; Global Ecology and Biogeography, 21, 1042–1052; here- afterW&amp;B)toinfer past fire regimeswith substantial moderate and high-severity burning.

Moreover, post-fire OLT provides an indicator of long-term successional trajectories and permafrost susceptibility to thaw. To these ends, we 1) mapped OLT and associated uncertainty at 30m resolution in the Yukon River Basin (YRB), Alaska, employing decision tree models linking remotely sensed imagery with field and ancillary data, 2) converted OLT to OLC using a non-linear regression, 3) evaluate landscape controls on OLT and OLC, and 4) quantified the post-fire recovery of OLT and OLC. Areas of shallow (&lt;10cm), moderate (≥10cm and &lt;20cm), moderately thick (≥20cm and &lt;30cm), and thick (≥30cm) OLT, composed 34, 20, 14, and 18% of the YRB, respectively; the average OLT was 19.4cm. Total OLC was estimated to be 3.38Pg. A regional chronosequence analysis over 30years revealed that OLT and OLC increased with stand age (OLT: R2=0.68; OLC: R2=0.66), where an average of 16cm OLT and 5.3kg/m2 OLC were consumed by fires. Strong predictors of OLT included climate, topography, near-surface permafrost distributions, soil wetness, and spectral information. Our modeling approach enabled us to produce regional maps of OLT and OLC, which will be useful in understanding risks and feedbacks associated with fires and climate feedbacks. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70102282</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cole, Christopher J</author><author>Friesen, Beverly A</author><author>Wilson, Earl M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Use of satellite imagery to identify vegetation cover changes following the Waldo Canyon Fire event, Colorado, 2012-2013</title></titles><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2014-1078</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20141078</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reynolds, Richard L.</author><author>Goldstein, Harland L.</author><author>Moskowitz, Bruce M.</author><author>Bryant, Ann C.</author><author>Skiles, S.

These studies are required to comprehend and model how such dust-on-snow (DOS) layers affect rates of snow melt through changes in the albedo of snow surfaces. We evaluated several constituents as potential contributors to the absorption of solar radiation indicated by values of absolute reflectance determined from bi-conical reflectance spectroscopy. Ferric oxide minerals and carbonaceous matter appear to be the primary influences on lowering snow-cover albedo. Techniques of reflectance and Mössbauer spectroscopy as well as rock magnetism provide information about the types, amounts, and grain sizes of ferric oxide minerals. Relatively high amounts of ferric oxide, indicated by hard isothermal remanent magnetization (HIRM), are associated with relatively low average reflectance (&lt;0.25) across the visible wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. Mössbauer spectroscopy indicates roughly equal amounts of hematite and goethite, representing about 35% of the total Fe-bearing phases. Nevertheless, goethite (α-FeOOH) is the dominant ferric oxide found by reflectance spectroscopy and thus appears to be the main iron oxide control on absorption of solar radiation. At least some goethite occurs as nano-phase grain coatings less than about 50. nm thick. Relatively high amounts of organic carbon, indicating as much as about 10% organic matter, are also associated with lower reflectance values. The organic matter, although not fully characterized by type, correlates strongly with metals (e.g., Cu, Pb, As, Cd, Mo, Zn) derived from distal urban and industrial settings, probably including mining and smelting sites. This relation suggests anthropogenic sources for at least some of the carbonaceous matter, such as emissions from transportation and industrial activities. The composition of the DOS samples can be compared with sediments in a likely dust-source setting at the Milford Flat Fire (MFF) area about 225. km southwest of Salt Lake City. The MFF area represents geologically and physiographically similar and widespread dust sources west-southwest of the Wasatch Range and heavily populated Wasatch Front. The DOS layers and MFF sediments are similar in some textural, chemical, and magnetic properties, as well as in the common presence of goethite, hematite, magnetite-bearing basalt fragments, quartz, plagioclase, illite, and kaolinite. Textural and some chemical differences among these deposits can be explained by atmospheric sorting as well as by inputs from other settings, such as salt-crusted playas and contaminant sources.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70187408</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Staley, Dennis M.</author><author>Wasklewicz, Thad A.</author><author>Kean, Jason W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Characterizing the primary material sources and dominant erosional processes for post-fire debris-flow initiation in a headwater basin using multi-temporal terrestrial laser scanning data</title><secondary-title>Geomorphology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geomorphology</full-title></periodical><pages>324-338</pages><volume>214</volume><keywords><keyword>California</keyword><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Erosion</keyword><keyword>Debris flow</keyword><keyword>Geomorphic change detection</keyword><keyword>San Gabriel Mountains</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0169-555X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.geomorph.2014.02.015</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Wildfire dramatically alters the hydrologic response of a watershed such that even modest rainstorms can produce hazardous debris flows. Relative to shallow landslides, the primary sources of material and dominant erosional processes that contribute to post-fire debris-flow initiation are poorly constrained. Improving our understanding of how and where material is eroded from a watershed during a post-fire debris-flow requires (1) precise measurements of topographic change to calculate volumetric measurements of erosion and deposition, and (2) the identification of relevant morphometrically defined process domains to spatially constrain these measurements of erosion and deposition. In this study, we combine the morphometric analysis of a steep, small (0.01km2) headwater drainage basin with measurements of topographic change using high-resolution (2.5cm) multi-temporal terrestrial laser scanning data made before and after a post-fire debris flow. The results of the morphometric analysis are used to define four process domains: hillslope-divergent, hillslope-convergent, transitional, and channelized incision. We determine that hillslope-divergent and hillslope-convergent process domains represent the primary sources of material over the period of analysis in the study basin. From these results we conclude that raindrop-impact induced erosion, ravel, surface wash, and rilling are the primary erosional processes contributing to post-fire debris-flow initiation in the small, steep headwater basin. Further work is needed to determine (1) how these results vary with increasing drainage basin size, (2) how these data might scale upward for use with coarser resolution measurements of topography, and (3) how these results change with evolving sediment supply conditions and vegetation recovery. © 2014.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70093470</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Peterson, Birgit</author><author>Nelson, Kurtis J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mapping forest height in Alaska using GLAS, landsat composites, and airborne LiDAR</title><secondary-title>Remote Sensing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Remote Sensing</full-title></periodical><pages>12409-12426</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>LANDFIRE</keyword><keyword>Alaska</keyword><keyword>GLAS</keyword><keyword>LiDAR</keyword><keyword>Forest height</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1605594652</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/rs61212409</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Vegetation structure, including forest canopy height, is an important input variable to fire behavior modeling systems for simulating wildfire behavior. As such, forest canopy height is one of a nationwide suite of products generated by the LANDFIRE program. In the past, LANDFIRE has relied on a combination of field observations and Landsat imagery to develop existing vegetation structure products. The paucity of field data in the remote Alaskan forests has led to a very simple forest canopy height classification for the original LANDFIRE forest height map.

A sedimentary sequence that was recently discovered in a small canyon on San Nicolas Island contains evidence of at least 24 burn events that date to between ~37 and 25 ka (thousands of calibrated 14C years before present), well before humans entered North America. The evidence includes abundant macroscopic charcoal, blackened sediments, and discrete packages of oxidized, reddish-brown sediments that are similar in appearance to sedimentary features called "fire areas" on Santa Rosa Island and elsewhere. Massive fine-grained sediments that contain the burn evidence are interpreted as sheetwash deposits and are interbedded with coarse-grained, clast-supported alluvial sediments and matrix-supported sands, pebbles, and cobbles that represent localized debris flows. These sedimentary sequences suggest that the catchment area above our study site underwent multiple cycles of relative quiescence that were interrupted by fire and followed by slope instability and mass wasting events. Our 14C-based chronology dates these cycles to well before the arrival of humans on the Channel Islands and shows that natural wildfires occurred here, at a minimum, every 300-500 years prior to human occupation.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.bioone.org/doi/10.3398/042.007.0107</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Douglas, Thomas A.</author><author>Jones, Miriam C.</author><author>Hiemstra, Christopher A.</author><author>Arnold, Jeffrey R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sources and sinks of carbon in boreal ecosystems of interior Alaska: A review</title><secondary-title>Elementa: Science of the Anthropocene</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Elementa: Science of the Anthropocene</full-title></periodical><pages>000032-000032</pages><volume>2</volume><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.12952/journal.elementa.000032</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.elementascience.org/articles/10.12952/journal.elementa.000032</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kurth, Valerie J.</author><author>D’Amato, Anthony W.</author><author>Palik, Brian J.</author><author>Bradford, John B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fifteen-Year Patterns of Soil Carbon and Nitrogen Following Biomass Harvesting</title><secondary-title>Soil Science Society of America Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Soil Science Society of America Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>624-624</pages><volume>78</volume><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2136/sssaj2013.08.0360</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A growing interest in utilizing forest-derived biofuels as a substitution for fossil fuels has led to related questions about the long-term impacts of increasing organic matter removal on forest structure and function (Jurgensen et al., 1997; Janowiak and Webster, 2010; Berger et al., 2013). In par-ticular, the removal of entire trees, including boles, tops, and branches (whole-tree removal, WTH), is likely to cause a greater depletion of soil organic matter and nutrients over time compared with conventional stem-only harvest (SOH), and this may ultimately limit site productivity (Proe and Dutch, 1994; Burger, 2002; Walmsley et al., 2009). Nonetheless, literature reviews and meta-analyses have of-ten concluded that harvest-related impacts on mineral soil C pools are negligible (Johnson, 1992; Johnson and Curtis, 2001; Nave et al., 2010), and many broad-scale studies have been confounded by site-to-site complexity among climate, veg-etation, and soil factors, which limits the ability to generalize the impacts of or-ganic matter removal (Paré et al., 2002; Sanchez et al., 2006; Thiffault et al., 2006; Strömgren et al., 2013). Additional field experiments that assess medium-and long-term effects of WTH and SOH across a gradient of mineral soil textures and organic C contents would both improve cross-site comparisons and contribute to more robust meta-analyses (Johnson, 1992; Thiffault et al., 2011).</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.soils.org/publications/sssaj/abstracts/78/2/624</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Connot, Joel A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>LANDFIRE 2001 and 2008 refresh: geographic area report: Alaska</title></titles><pages>71-71</pages><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70103363</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pierce, Kenneth L.</author><author>Licciardi, Joseph M.</author><author>Krause, Teresa R.</author><author>Whitlock, Cathy</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Glacial and Quaternary geology of the northern Yellowstone area, Montana and Wyoming</title><secondary-title>Exploring the Northern Rocky Mountains</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Exploring the Northern Rocky Mountains</full-title></periodical><pages>189-203</pages><volume>37</volume><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>978-0-8137-0037-3</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1130/2014.0037(09)</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This field guide focuses on the glacial geology and paleoecology&#xD;beginning in the Paradise Valley and progressing southward into northern&#xD;Yellowstone National Park. During the last (Pinedale) glaciation, the&#xD;northern Yellowstone outlet glacier flowed out of Yellowstone Park and&#xD;down the Yellowstone River Valley into the Paradise Valley. The field&#xD;trip will traverse the following Pinedale glacial sequence: (1)&#xD;deposition of the Eightmile terminal moraines and outwash 16.5 +/- 1.4&#xD;Be-10 ka in the Paradise Valley; (2) glacial recession of similar to 8&#xD;km and deposition of the Chico moraines and outwash 16.1 +/- 1.7 Be-10&#xD;ka; (3) glacial recession of 45 km to near the northern Yellowstone&#xD;boundary and moraine deposition during the Deckard Flats readjustment&#xD;14.2 +/- 1.2 Be-10 ka; and (4) glacial recession of similar to 37 km and&#xD;deposition of the Junction Butte moraines 15.2 +/- 1.3 Be-10 ka (this&#xD;age is a little too old based on the stratigraphic sequence).&#xD;Yellowstone's northern range of sagebrush-grasslands and bison, elk,&#xD;wolf, and bear inhabitants is founded on glacial moraines, sub-glacial&#xD;till, and outwash deposited during the last glaciation. Floods released&#xD;from glacially dammed lakes and a landslide-dammed lake punctuate this&#xD;record.&#xD;The glacial geologic reconstruction was evaluated by calculation of&#xD;basal shear stress, and yielded the following values for flow pattern in&#xD;plan view: strongly converging-1.21 +/- 0.12 bars (n = 15); nearly&#xD;uniform-1.04 +/- 0.16 bars (n = 11); and strongly diverging-0.84 +/-&#xD;0.14 bars (n = 16). Reconstructed mass balance yielded accumulation and&#xD;ablation each of similar to 3 km(3)/yr, with glacial movement near the&#xD;equilibrium line altitude dominated by basal sliding.&#xD;Pollen and charcoal records from three lakes in northern Yellowstone&#xD;provide information on the postglacial vegetation and fire history.&#xD;Following glacial retreat, sparsely vegetated landscapes were colonized&#xD;first by spruce parkland and then by closed subalpine forests. Regional&#xD;fire activity increased significantly with the development of closed&#xD;subalpine forests as a result of increased fuel biomass and warmer&#xD;summers. Warm dry conditions prevailed at low elevations during the&#xD;early Holocene, as indicated by the presence of steppe and open mixed&#xD;conifer forest. At the same time, closed subalpine forests with low fire&#xD;frequency were present at higher elevations, suggesting relatively wet&#xD;summer conditions. Douglas fir populations expanded throughout northern&#xD;Yellowstone in the middle Holocene as a result of effectively drier&#xD;conditions than before, and a decline of mesophytic plant taxa during&#xD;the late Holocene imply continued drying, even though fire frequency&#xD;decreased in recent millennia.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://fieldguides.gsapubs.org/lookup/doi/10.1130/2014.0037(09)</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Collins, Brandon M.</author><author>Das, Adrian J.</author><author>Battles, John J.</author><author>Fry, Danny L.</author><author>Krasnow, Kevin D.</author><author>Stephens, Scott L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Beyond reducing fire hazard: Fuel treatment impacts on overstory tree survival</title><secondary-title>Ecological Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>1879-1886</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Restoration</keyword><keyword>Sierra Nevada</keyword><keyword>Forest resilience</keyword><keyword>Frequent-fire forests</keyword><keyword>Large trees</keyword><keyword>Mixed-conifer forest</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0849309670</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1890/14-0971.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Logging is a larger cause of adult tree mortality in northeastern U.S. forests than all other causes of mortality combined. We used Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data to develop statistical models to quantify three different aspects of aggregate regional forest harvest regimes: (1) the annual probability that a plot is logged, as a function of total aboveground tree biomass, (2) the fraction of adult tree basal area removed if a plot was logged, and (3) the probability that an individual tree within a plot was removed, as a function of the fraction of basal area removed at the plot level, the species of tree, and its size. Results confirm that relatively frequent partial harvesting dominates the logging regimes, but with significant variation among different parts of the region and different forest types. The harvest regimes have similarities with natural disturbance regimes in imposing spatially and temporally dynamic mortality that varies predictably as a function of stand structure as well as tree species and size.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70135356</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hawbaker, T.J.</author><author>Zhu, Z.</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Zhu, Z.</author><author>Reed, B.</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Wildland Fire Occurrence and Emissions in the Eastern United States From 2001 Through 2050</title><secondary-title>Baseline and Projected Future Carbon Storage and Greenhouse- Gas Fluxes in Ecosystems of the Eastern United States</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Baseline and Projected Future Carbon Storage and Greenhouse- Gas Fluxes in Ecosystems of the Eastern United States</full-title></periodical><pages>7-16</pages><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>https://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/1804/</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>West, Daniel R.</author><author>Briggs, Jennifer S.</author><author>Jacobi, William R.</author><author>Negrón, José F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mountain pine beetle-caused mortality over eight years in two pine hosts in mixed-conifer stands of the southern Rocky Mountains</title><secondary-title>Forest Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forest Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>321-330</pages><volume>334</volume><keywords><keyword>Ponderosa pine</keyword><keyword>Dendroctonus ponderosae</keyword><keyword>Forest disturbance</keyword><keyword>Hopkins' host selection principle</keyword><keyword>Host selection</keyword><keyword>Lodgepole pine</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>December 2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0378-1127</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.foreco.2014.09.012</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Eruptive mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae, MPB) populations have caused widespread mortality of pines throughout western North America since the late 1990s. Early work by A.D. Hopkins suggested that when alternate host species are available, MPB will prefer to breed in the host to which it has become adapted. In Colorado, epidemic MPB populations that originated in lodgepole pine expanded into mixed-conifer stands containing ponderosa pine, a related host. We evaluated the susceptibility of both hosts to successful MPB colonization in a survey of 19 sites in pine-dominated mixed-conifer stands spanning 140. km of the Front Range, CO, USA. In each of three 0.2-ha plots at each site, we (1) assessed trees in the annual flights of 2008-2011 to compare MPB-caused mortality between lodgepole and ponderosa pine; (2) recorded previous MPB-caused tree mortality from 2004-2007 to establish baseline mortality levels; and (3) measured characteristics of the stands (e.g. tree basal area) and sites (e.g. elevation, aspect) that might be correlated with MPB colonization. Uninfested average live basal area of lodgepole and ponderosa pine was 74% of total basal area before 2004. We found that for both species, annual percent basal area of attacked trees was greatest in one year (2009), and was lower in all other years (2004-2007, 2008, 2010, and 2011). Both pine species had similar average total mortality of 38-39% by 2011. Significant predictors of ponderosa pine mortality in a given year were basal area of uninfested ponderosa pine and the previous year's mortality levels in both ponderosa and lodgepole pine. Lodgepole pine mortality was predicted by uninfested basal areas of both lodgepole and ponderosa pine, and the previous year's lodgepole pine mortality. These results indicate host selection by MPB from lodgepole pine natal hosts into ponderosa pine the following year, but not the reverse. In both species, diameters of attacked trees within each year were similar, and were progressively smaller the last four years of the study period. Our results suggest that, in contrast to previous reports, ponderosa and lodgepole pine were equally susceptible to MPB infestation in the CO Front Range during our study period. This suggests that forest managers may anticipate similar impacts in both hosts during similar environmental conditions when epidemic-level MPB populations are active in mixed-pine stands.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378112714005398</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app

Increasing air temperatures have led to widespread thawing and degradation of permafrost, which in turn has affected ecosystems, socioeconomics, and the carbon cycle of high latitudes. Here we overcome complex interactions among surface and subsurface conditions to map near-surface permafrost through decision and regression tree approaches that statistically and spatially extend field observations using remotely sensed imagery, climatic data, and thematic maps of a wide range of surface and subsurface biophysical characteristics. The data fusion approach generated medium-resolution (30-m. pixels) maps of near-surface (within 1 m) permafrost, active-layer thickness, and associated uncertainty estimates throughout mainland Alaska. Our calibrated models (overall test accuracy of ~85%) were used to quantify changes in permafrost distribution under varying future climate scenarios assuming no other changes in biophysical factors. Models indicate that near-surface permafrost underlies 38% of mainland Alaska and that near-surface permafrost will disappear on 16 to 24% of the landscape by the end of the 21st Century. Simulations suggest that near-surface permafrost degradation is more probable in central regions of Alaska than more northerly regions. Taken together, these results have obvious implications for potential remobilization of frozen soil carbon pools under warmer temperatures. Additionally, warmer and drier conditions may increase fire activity and severity, which may exacerbate rates of permafrost thaw and carbon remobilization relative to climate alone. The mapping of permafrost distribution across Alaska is important for land-use planning, environmental assessments, and a wide-array of geophysical studies.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70155172</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Matchett, John R</author><author>Lutz, James A.</author><author>Tarnay, Leland W</author><author>Smith, Douglas G</author><author>Becker, Kendall M.L.</author><author>Brooks, M L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impacts of Fire Management on Aboveground Tree Carbon Stocks in Yosemite and Sequoia &amp; Kings Canyon National Parks</title></titles><pages>28-28</pages><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Forest biomass on Sierra Nevada landscapes constitutes one of the largest carbon stocks in California, and its stability is tightly linked to the factors driving fire regimes. Research suggests that fire suppression, logging, climate change, and present management practices in Sierra Nevada forests have altered historic patterns of landscape carbon storage, and over a century of fire suppression and the resulting accumulation in surface fuels have been implicated in contributing to recent increases in high severity, stand-replacing fires. For over 30 years, fire management at Yosemite (YOSE) and Sequoia &amp; Kings Canyon (SEKI) national parks has led the nation in restoring fire to park landscapes; however, the impacts on the stability and magnitude of carbon stocks have not been thoroughly examined. The purpose of this study is to quantify relationships between recent fire patterns and aboveground tree carbon stocks in YOSE and SEKI. Our approach focuses on evaluating fire effects on 1) amounts of aboveground tree carbon on the landscape, and 2) rates of carbon accumulation by individual trees. In 2010, we compiled a database of existing plot data for our analyses. In 2011, our field crews acquired vegetation data and collected tree growth cores from 105 plots. In 2012, we completed an interpretive component and began data analyses. In 2013, processing of tree cores began. In 2014, final processing of tree cores, data analyses, and manuscript preparation was conducted. The work for this project was facilitated through an interagency agreement between the National Park Service and the U.S. Geological Survey, and through a Cooperative Ecosystems Studies Unit (CESU) agreement with the University of Washington. In order to accurately quantify landscape-level carbon stocks, our analyses accounted for major sources of measurement errors, propagating those errors as we scaled plot-based carbon density estimates up to landscape-level totals. Using Monte Carlo simulation methods, we found that vegetation type mapping error was the largest source of uncertainty, while measurement uncertainties contributed by tree diameter measurements and tree diameter–biomass allometry equations were relatively minor. For some forest types, we found differences in aboveground tree carbon densities between burned and unburned areas. For example, mean carbon density in burned red fir forests was estimated to be ~29% lower versus unburned areas. Alternative measures of fire history, such as time since fire and number of times burned, were poorly related to carbon densities. Within YOSE, we evaluated the stability of landscape carbon pools by quantifying carbon stocks in areas of varying degrees of departure from historic fire return intervals. Of the ~25 Tg of total aboveground tree carbon in YOSE, ~10 Tg is contained within relatively stable areas (the next fire is unlikely to be high severity and stand-replacing), ~10 Tg occurs in areas deemed moderately stable, and the remaining ~5 Tg within relatively unstable areas. We compared our landscape carbon estimates in YOSE to remotely-sensed carbon estimates from the NASA–CASA project and found that the two methods roughly agree. Our analysis and comparisons suggest, however, that fire severity should be integrated into future carbon mapping efforts. We illustrate this with an example using the 2013 Rim Fire, which we estimate burned an area containing over 5 Tg of aboveground tree carbon, but likely left a large fraction of that carbon on the landscape if one accounts for fire severity.</abstract><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.werc.usgs.gov/ProductDetails.aspx?ID=5177</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nesmith, Jonathan C.B.</author><author>Das, Adrian J.</author><author>O’Hara, Kevin L.</author><author>van Mantgem, Phillip J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The influence of prefire tree growth and crown condition on postfire mortality of sugar pine following prescribed fire in Sequoia National Park</title><secondary-title>Canadian Journal of Forest Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canadian Journal of Forest Research</full-title></periodical><pages>910-919</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>7</issue><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/cjfr-2014-0449</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Tree mortality is a vital component of forest management in the context of prescribed fires; however, few studies have examined the effect of prefire tree health on postfire mortality. This is especially relevant for sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana Douglas), a species experiencing population declines due to a suite of anthropogenic factors. Using data from an old-growth mixed-conifer forest in Sequoia National Park, we evaluated the effects of fire, tree size, prefire radial growth, and crown condition on postfire mortality. Models based only on tree size and measures of fire damage were compared with models that included tree size, fire damage, and prefire tree health (e.g., measures of prefire tree radial growth or crown condition). Immediately following the fire, the inclusion of different metrics of prefire tree health produced variable improvements over the models that included only tree size and measures of fire damage, as models that included measures of crown condition performed better than fire-only models, but models that included measures of prefire radial growth did not perform better. However, 5 years following the fire, sugar pine mortality was best predicted by models that included measures of both fire damage and prefire tree health, specifically, diameter at breast height (DBH, 1.37 m), crown scorch, 30-year mean growth, and the number of sharp declines in growth over a 30-year period. This suggests that factors that influence prefire tree health (e.g., drought, competition, pathogens, etc.) may partially determine postfire mortality, especially when accounting for delayed mortality following fire.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/10.1139/cjfr-2014-0449</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Munson, Seth M.</author><author>Long, A.

Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) is a non-native annual grass in the western U.S. that both spreads quickly following fire and accelerates the fire cycle. Herbicide and seeding applications are common restoration practices to break the positive fire-invasion feedback loop and recover native perennial species, but their interactive effects have infrequently been tested at the landscape-scale and repeated in time to encourage long-lasting effects. We determined the efficacy of repeated post-fire application of the herbicide imazapic and seeding treatments to suppress Bromus abundance and promote perennial vegetation recovery. We found that the selective herbicide reduced Bromus cover by *30 % and density by [50 % across our study sites, but had a strong initial negative effect on seeded species. The most effective treatment to promote perennial seeded species cover was seeding them alone followed by herbicide appli-cation 3 years later when the seeded species had established. The efficacy of the treatments was strongly influenced by water availability, as precipi-tation positively affected the density and cover of Bromus; soil texture and aspect secondarily influenced Bromus abundance and seeded species cover by modifying water retention in this semi-arid region. Warmer temperatures positively affected the non-native annual grass in the cool-season, but negatively affected seeded perennial species in the warm-season, suggesting an important role of seasonality in a region projected to experience large increases in warming in the future. Our results highlight the importance of environmental interactions and repeated treatments in influencing restoration outcomes at the landscape-scale.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70140627</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jones, Benjamin M.</author><author>Grosse, Guido</author><author>Arp, Christopher D.</author><author>Miller, Eric</author><author>Liu, Lin</author><author>Hayes, Daniel J.</author><author>Larsen, Christopher F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Recent Arctic tundra fire initiates widespread thermokarst development</title><secondary-title>Scientific Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Reports</full-title></periodical><pages>1-13</pages><volume>5</volume><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2045-2322</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/srep15865</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fire-induced permafrost degradation is well documented in boreal forests, but the role of fires in initiating thermokarst development in Arctic tundra is less well understood. Here we show that Arctic tundra fires may induce widespread thaw subsidence of permafrost terrain in the first seven years following the disturbance. Quantitative analysis of airborne LiDAR data acquired two and seven years post-fire, detected permafrost thaw subsidence across 34% of the burned tundra area studied, compared to less than 1% in similar undisturbed, ice-rich tundra terrain units. The variability in thermokarst development appears to be influenced by the interaction of tundra fire burn severity and near-surface, ground-ice content. Subsidence was greatest in severely burned, ice-rich upland terrain (yedoma), accounting for ~50% of the detected subsidence, despite representing only 30% of the fire disturbed study area. Microtopography increased by 340% in this terrain unit as a result of ice wedge degradation. Increases in the frequency, magnitude, and severity of tundra fires will contribute to future thermokarst development and associated landscape change in Arctic tundra regions.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70159657</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shinneman, Douglas</author><author>Pilliod, David</author><author>Arkle, Robert</author><author>Glenn, Nancy F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantifying and predicting fuels and the effects of reduction treatments along successional and invasion gradients in sagebrush habitats</title></titles><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70159656</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rosenberger, Amanda E.</author><author>Dunham, Jason B.</author><author>Neuswanger, Jason R.</author><author>Railsback, Steven F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Legacy effects of wildfire on stream thermal regimes and rainbow trout ecology: an integrated analysis of observation and individual-based models</title><secondary-title>Freshwater Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Freshwater Science</full-title></periodical><pages>1571-1584</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1086/683338</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Management of aquatic resources in fire-prone areas requires understanding of fish species' responses to wildfire and of the intermediate-and long-term consequences of these disturbances. We examined Rainbow Trout populations in 9 headwater streams 10 y after a major wildfire: 3 with no history of severe wildfire in the watershed (unburned), 3 in severely burned watersheds (burned), and 3 in severely burned watersheds sub-jected to immediate events that scoured the stream channel and eliminated streamside vegetation (burned and reorganized). Results of a previous study of this system suggested the primary lasting effects of this wildfire history on headwater stream habitat were differences in canopy cover and solar radiation, which led to higher summer stream temperatures. Nevertheless, trout were present throughout streams in burned watersheds. Older age classes were least abundant in streams draining watersheds with a burned and reorganized history, and in-dividuals &gt;1 y old were most abundant in streams draining watersheds with an unburned history. Burned history corresponded with fast growth, low lipid content, and early maturity of Rainbow Trout. We used an individual-based model of Rainbow Trout growth and demographic patterns to determine if temperature interactions with bioenergetics and competition among individuals could lead to observed phenotypic and ecological differences among populations in the absence of other plausible mechanisms. Modeling suggested that moderate warming associated with wildfire and channel disturbance history leads to faster individual growth, which exacerbates competition for limited food, leading to decreases in population densities. The inferred mechanisms from this modeling exercise suggest the transferability of ecological patterns to a variety of temperature-warming scenarios. Disturbance, such as wildfire, is a fundamental compo-nent of ecosystems (Sousa 1984). In riverine ecosystems, disturbance often is manifested through floods and droughts, which have immediate effects but also may create intermediate-to long-term changes in habitat configura-tions that can shape aquatic species' life history, behavior, and morphology (Lytle and Poff 2003, Stanley et al. 2010). Thus, as the nature, pattern, and history of disturbance change over time and space, so too may the characteristics of the species and ecosystems themselves (Parmesan 2006, Hof et al. 2008, Reed et al. 2011). In particular, change in stream disturbance regimes is a likely prospect if future climates warm (Wenger et al. 2011, Arismendi et al. 2012), especially if warming leads to increased incidence and se-verity of wildfire (Westerling et al. 2006, Rieman et al. 2010). Within the course of hours to days, wildfires can burn forests and riparian vegetation in headwater stream watersheds, and the combination of severe wildfire and</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/683338</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reisner, Michael D.</author><author>Doescher, Paul S.</author><author>Pyke, David A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Stress-gradient hypothesis explains susceptibility to Bromus tectorum invasion and community stability in North America's semi-arid Artemisia tridentata wyomingensis ecosystems</title><secondary-title>Journal of Vegetation Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Vegetation Science</full-title></periodical><pages>1212-1224</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Disturbance</keyword><keyword>Cheatgrass</keyword><keyword>Facilitation</keyword><keyword>Sagebrush</keyword><keyword>Artemisia</keyword><keyword>Caespitose bunchgrass</keyword><keyword>Cattle</keyword><keyword>Competition</keyword><keyword>Heat stress</keyword><keyword>Water stress</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1100-9233</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvs.12327</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Abbreviations Artemisia = Artemisia tridentata subsp. wyomingensis; BLM = U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management; ISA = indicator species analysis; MRPP = multi-response permutation procedures; NMS = non-metric multidimensional scaling; NPMR = non-parametric multiplicative regression; NRCS = U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service; SGH = stress-gradient hypothesis; SIR = severity–interaction relationship. Abstract Questions: (1) What combinations of overlapping water and heat stress and herbivory disturbance gradients are associated with shifts in interactions between Artemisia tridentata subsp. wyomingensis (Artemisia) and herbaceous ben-eficiary species?

(3) Do such relationships differ for native and non-native beneficiaries? (4) What are the implications of any observed shifts in interac-tions between community compositional stability in space and susceptibility to invasion? Location: North American Artemisia communities. Methods: We tested the stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) in an observational study consisting of 75 sites located along overlapping water and heat stress and disturbance gradients. We used spatial patterns of association among Artemisia and six native and two non-native beneficiary species; including the invasive annual grass Bromus tectorum, representing a diverse array of life history strate-gies, to infer whether the net outcome of interactions was facilitation or compe-tition. We assessed implications for community stability by examining shifts in community composition in space and resistance to invasion. Results/Conclusions: Cattle herbivory, a novel disturbance and selective force, was a significant component of two overlapping stress gradients most strongly associated with observed shifts in interactions. Facilitation and competition were strongest and most frequent at the highest and lowest stress levels along both gradients, respectively. Contrasting ecological optima among native and non-native beneficiaries led to strikingly different patterns of interactions. The four native bunchgrasses with the strongest competitive response abilities exhib-ited the strongest facilitation at their upper limits of stress tolerance, while the two non-natives exhibited the strongest competition at the highest stress levels, which coincided with their maximum abundance. Artemisia facilitation enhanced stability at intermediate stress levels by providing a refuge for native bunchgrasses, which in turn reduced the magnitude of B. tectorum invasion. However, facilitation was a destabilizing force at the highest stress levels when native bunchgrasses became obligate beneficiaries dependent on facilitation for their persistence. B. tectorum dominated these communities, and the next fire may convert them to annual grasslands.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70156546</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McCreedy, Chris</author><author>van Riper, Charles</author><author>Esque, Todd C</author><author>Darrah, Abigail J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of Drought and Fire on Bird Communities of the Kofa National Wildlife Refuge, Arizona</title></titles><pages>34 p-34 p</pages><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2015-1240</isbn><abstract>In southeastern California, from 2004 to 2009, we found that, among all 13 bird species for which we have sufficient sample size, the nest initiation date was later when there was less rainfall during the four-month winter rainy season preceding nesting. Nesting was delayed more than three weeks for some species during extreme droughts in 2006 and 2007. During the same period, we found nesting success to be positively associated with winter rainfall for the Black-tailed Gnatcatcher (Polioptila melanura). Because climate models are nearly unanimous in their predictions for increased drought frequency in the southwestern U.S., drought-delayed nesting may play an important role in nesting success and productivity for many Sonoran Desert bird species in the future. To investigate the effect of breeding phenology on nesting success and productivity, we conducted a manipulative experiment with Black-tailed Gnatcatchers and Verdins (Auriparus flaviceps). Following a wet winter in 2009–2010, we delayed clutch initiation dates for treatment pairs in spring 2010 to match the late first- egg dates that we had observed during previous droughts in 2006 and 2007. Undelayed first clutches had 1.8 times (Verdin) to 2.8 times (Black-tailed Gnatcatcher) higher odds of success than delayed first clutches. Diminishing daily nest survival rates over the remainder of the breeding season prohibited delayed pairs from overcoming the lost period of high productivity in March and early April, and delayed treatment pairs had lower productivity over the course of the entire breeding season than undelayed control pairs. As nest depredation and parasitism were the most common causes of nest failure, we conclude that drought impacts on annual reproductive output in the Sonoran Desert may be mediated by parasitism and depredation among Black-tailed Gnatcatchers and by depredation among Verdins.</abstract><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20151240</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Scoles-Sciulla, Sara J.</author><author>DeFalco, Lesley A.</author><author>Esque, Todd C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Contrasting Long-Term Survival of Two Outplanted Mojave Desert Perennials for Post-Fire Revegetation</title><secondary-title>Arid Land Research and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Arid Land Research and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>110-124</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>restoration</keyword><keyword>Coleogyne ramosissima</keyword><keyword>Ephedra nevadensis</keyword><keyword>rehabilitation</keyword><keyword>transplant</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1532-4982</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/15324982.2014.901994</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Post-fire recovery of arid shrublands is typically slow, and planting greenhouse-raised seedlings may be a means of jump-starting this process. Recovery can be further accelerated by understanding the factors controlling post-planting survival. In fall 2007 and 2009, we outplanted seedlings of two contrasting native evergreen shrubs—fast-growing Nevada jointfir and slow-growing blackbrush—across five burned sites in the Mojave Desert. To increase soil moisture and optimize seedling survival, we experimentally applied and evaluated soil amendments and supplemental watering. We also evaluated two herbicides that reduce competitive invasive annual grasses and two types of herbivore protection. Survival of jointfir outplanted in 2007 was 61% after 43 months, and site largely influenced survival, while herbicide containing imazapic applied more than one year after outplanting reduced survival. Reduced survival of jointfir outplanted in 2009 coincided with delayed seasonal precipitation that intensified foliar damage by small mammals. In contrast, blackbrush survival was 4% after 43 months, and was influenced by site, type of herbivore protection, and greenhouse during the 2007 outplanting, and soil amendment during 2009. Counter to expectations, we found that supplemental watering and soil amendments did not influence long-term survival of either blackbrush or jointfir. Shrub species with rapid growth rates and broad environmental tolerances, such as jointfir, make ideal candidates for outplanting, provided that seedlings are protected from herbivores. Re-introduction of species with slow growth rates and narrow environmental tolerances, such as blackbrush, requires careful consideration to optimize pre- and post-planting conditions.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70124041</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lockyer, Zachary B.</author><author>Coates, Peter S.</author><author>Casazza, Michael L.</author><author>Espinosa, Shawn</author><author>Delehanty, David J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nest-site selection and reproductive success of greater sage-grouse in a fire-affected habitat of northwestern Nevada</title><secondary-title>Journal of Wildlife Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Wildlife Management</full-title></periodical><pages>785-797</pages><volume>79</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Nevada</keyword><keyword>Bromus tectorum</keyword><keyword>cheatgrass</keyword><keyword>sagebrush</keyword><keyword>Centrocercus urophasianus</keyword><keyword>Artemisia</keyword><keyword>greater sage-grouse</keyword><keyword>habitat selection</keyword><keyword>micro-habitat</keyword><keyword>nest survival</keyword><keyword>percent shrub cover</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-541X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jwmg.899</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Identifying links between micro-habitat selection and wildlife reproduction is imperative to population persistence and recovery. This information is particularly important for landscape species such as greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse). Although this species has been widely studied, because environmental factors can affect sage-grouse populations, local and regional studies are crucial for developing viable conservation strategies. We studied the habitat-use patterns of 71 radio-marked sage-grouse inhabiting an area affected by wildfire in the Virginia Mountains of northwestern Nevada during 2009–2011 to determine the effect of micro-habitat attributes on reproductive success. We measured standard vegetation parameters at nest and random sites using a multi-scale approach (range ¼ 0.01– 15,527 ha). We used an information-theoretic modeling approach to identify environmental factors influencing nest-site selection and survival, and determine whether nest survival was a function of resource selection. Sage-grouse selected micro-sites with greater shrub canopy cover and less cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) cover than random sites. Total shrub canopy, including sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) and other shrub species, at small spatial scales (0.8 ha and 3.1 ha) was the single contributing selection factor to higher nest survival. These results indicate that reducing the risk of wildfire to maintain important sagebrush habitats could be emphasized in sage-grouse conservation strategies in Nevada. Managers may seek to mitigate the influx of annual grass invasion by preserving large intact sagebrush-dominated stands with a mixture of other shrub species. For this area of Nevada, the results suggest that !40% total shrub canopy cover in sage-grouse nesting areas could yield improved reproductive success. Published 2015. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA. Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse) have been the focus of increased study because of range-wide population declines (Connelly et al. 2011, Stiver 2011). Within Nevada, sage-grouse populations are estimated to have decreased by 50% from historical levels and some local populations have been reduced by 80% (Klebenow 2001). These declines have been linked to fragmentation of sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) ecosystems attributed to changing land-use practices and their effects on fire regimes, the occurrence of invasive and non-native species, disease transmission, and changes in predator composition and densities (Connelly et al. 2004, State of Nevada 2012). For example, largely as a result of increased fire frequency, the Great Basin has experienced landscape-scale conversions from sagebrush to areas dominated by cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum; Balch et al. 2013). Areas such as these may affect sage-grouse population persistence because of increased wildfire risks. Nevada's Strategic Plan for Conservation of Greater Sage-Grouse (State of Nevada 2012) identified habitat protection as the greatest priority for sage-grouse conservation, and wildfire with the subsequent conversion to invasive species as the most prominent threat. Large-scale changes in vegetation communities as a result of wildfires may also indirectly affect sage-grouse population vital rates through ecological mechanisms such as changes in predator composition and predation rates (Seymour et al. 2003, Evans 2004). Multiple factors spanning sage-grouse life stages likely are influencing population dynamics including sage-grouse nest survival as a central component of reproductive success. Nest survival appears to be a limiting factor in some sage-grouse</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70148590</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ebel, Brian A.</author><author>Rengers, Francis K.</author><author>Tucker, Gregory E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Aspect-dependent soil saturation and insight into debris-flow initiation during extreme rainfall in the Colorado front range</title><secondary-title>Geology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geology</full-title></periodical><pages>659-662</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>8</issue><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0091-7613</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1130/G36741.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Hydrologic processes during extreme rainfall events are poorly characterized because of the rarity of measurements. Improved understanding of hydrologic controls on natural hazards is needed because of the potential for substantial risk during extreme precipitation events. We present field measurements of the degree of soil saturation and estimates of available soil-water storage during the September 2013 Colorado extreme rainfall event at burned (wildfire in 2010) and unburned hillslopes with north- and south-facing slope aspects. Soil saturation was more strongly correlated with slope aspect than with recent fire history; south-facing hillslopes became fully saturated while north-facing hillslopes did not. Our results suggest multiple explanations for why aspect-dependent hydrologic controls favor saturation development on south-facing slopes, causing reductions in effective stress and triggering of slope failures during extreme rainfall. Aspect-dependent hydrologic behavior may result from (1) a larger gravel and stone fraction, and hence lower soil-water storage capacity, on south-facing slopes, and (2) lower weathered-bedrock permeability on south-facing slopes, because of lower tree density and associated deep roots penetrating bedrock as well as less intense weathering, inhibiting soil drainage.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70182182</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keeley, Jon E</author><author>Brennan, Teresa J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Research on the effects of wildland fire and fire management on federally listed species and their habitats on San Clemente Island, Southern California</title></titles><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston VA</pub-location><isbn>2015-1194</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20151194</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Duniway, M.

Active rehabilitation of fire-affected areas is often quickly initiated to minimize long-term ecosystem damage. However, the complex soil-geomorphic-vegetation patterns and low and variable moisture conditions in these regions makes restoration challenging. To further inform these post-fire management decisions, we present results from 5 years of vegetation and sediment flux monitoring following the Milford Flat Fire in west-central Utah, USA. Our sampling design includes monitoring plots in areas not burned, areas burned but where no rehabilitation was attempted, and burned areas where various rehabilitation approaches were implemented. At each of the 25 plots, vegetation cover and composition data were collected annually, and wind-driven sediment flux was measured using passive dust traps. To evaluate effectiveness of post-fire rehabilitation treatments in establishing desired species and limiting dominance of undesired species, we analyzed the temporal response of individual species and functional groups as well as community-level multivariate responses. The warm and dry conditions that persisted for approximately 12 months post-treatment, coupled with the surface disturbing rehabilitation approaches used, resulted in near-surface dust fluxes several orders of magnitude higher in treated areas than in unburned or burned areas where no rehabilitation occurred. These dry conditions and high surface sediment flux limited the establishment of seeded species in rehabilitation areas for nearly 3 years. Post-fire rehabilitation did not limit dominance by invasive annual species of concern. Perennial species composition in the areas burned but not subject to post-fire rehabilitation was relatively similar to unburned throughout the study period. In contrast, the burned plots where rehabilitation was attempted were characterized by no (&lt;3%) perennial cover or, in response to moister conditions, seeded forage species. These results suggest the post-fire rehabilitation efforts conducted in the lower elevation regions affected by the Milford Flat Fire were not generally successful. Though dry conditions are likely to blame for the lack of success, the low and variable precipitation characteristic of these regions suggest future post-fire rehabilitation decisions must assume that precipitation is going to be insufficient and plan rehabilitation efforts that are resilient to dry conditions.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://doi.wiley.com/10.1890/ES14-00318.1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Boyte, Stephen P.</author><author>Wylie, Bruce K.</author><author>Major, Donald J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mapping and monitoring cheatgrass dieoff in rangelands of the Northern Great Basin, USA</title><secondary-title>Rangeland Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Rangeland Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>18-28</pages><volume>68</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Bromus tectorum</keyword><keyword>MODIS</keyword><keyword>ecological models</keyword><keyword>invasive species</keyword><keyword>land cover change</keyword><keyword>Snake River Plain</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>15507424 (ISSN)</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.rama.2014.12.005</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Understanding cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) dynamics in the Northern Great Basin rangelands, USA, is necessary to effectively manage the region's lands. This study's goal was to map and monitor cheatgrass performance to identify where and when cheatgrass dieoff occurred in the Northern Great Basin and to discover how this phenomenon was affected by climatic, topographic, and edaphic variables. We also examined how fire affected cheatgrass performance. Land managers and scientists are concerned by cheatgrass dieoff because it can increase land degradation, and its causes and effects are not fully known. To better understand the scope of cheatgrass dieoff, we developed multiple ecological models that integrated remote sensing data with geophysical and biophysical data. The models' R2ranged from 0.71 to 0.88, and their root mean squared errors (RMSEs) ranged from 3.07 to 6.95. Validation of dieoff data showed that 41% of pixels within independently developed dieoff polygons were accurately classified as dieoff, whereas 2% of pixels outside of dieoff polygons were classified as dieoff. Site potential, a long-term spatial average of cheatgrass cover, dominated the development of the cheatgrass performance model. Fire negatively affected cheatgrass performance 1 year postfire, but by the second year postfire performance exceeded prefire levels. The landscape-scale monitoring study presented in this paper helps increase knowledge about recent rangeland dynamics, including where cheatgrass dieoffs occurred and how cheatgrass responded to fire. This knowledge can help direct further investigation and/or guide land management activities that can capitalize on, or mitigate the effects of, cheatgrass dieoff.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70140950</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Anderson, Lesleigh</author><author>Brunelle, Andrea</author><author>Thompson, Robert S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A multi-proxy record of hydroclimate, vegetation, fire, and post-settlement impacts for a subalpine plateau, central Rocky Mountains, U.S.A</title><secondary-title>Holocene</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Holocene</full-title></periodical><pages>932-943</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>grasslands</keyword><keyword>Colorado</keyword><keyword>charcoal</keyword><keyword>pollen</keyword><keyword>Bison Lake</keyword><keyword>subalpine</keyword><keyword>X-ray fluorescence</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0959683615</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0959683615574583</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Apparent changes in vegetation distribution, fire, and other disturbance regimes throughout western North America have prompted investigations of the relative importance of human activities and climate change as potential causal mechanisms. Assessing the effects of Euro-American settlement is difficult because climate changes occur on multi-decadal to centennial time scales and require longer time perspectives than historic observations can provide. Here, we report vegetation and environmental changes over the past ~13,000 years as recorded in a sediment record from Bison Lake, a subalpine lake on a high plateau in northwestern Colorado. Results are based on multiple independent proxies, which include pollen, charcoal, and elemental geochemistry, and are compared with previously reported interpretations of hydroclimatic changes from oxygen isotope ratios. The pollen data indicate a slowly changing vegetation sequence from sagebrush steppe during the late glacial to coniferous forest through the late Holocene. The most dramatic vegetation changes of the Holocene occurred during the ‘Medieval Climate Anomaly’ (MCA) and ‘Little Ice Age’ (LIA) with rapid replacement of conifer forest by grassland followed by an equally rapid return to conifer forest. Late Holocene vegetation responses are mirrored by changes in fire, lake biological productivity, and watershed erosion. These combined records indicate that subsequent disturbance related to Euro-American settlement, although perhaps significant, had acted upon a landscape that was already responding to MCA-LIA hydroclimatic change. Results document both rapid and long-term subalpine grassland ecosystem dynamics driven by agents of change that can be anticipated in the future and simulated by ecosystem models.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70136073</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Falcone, James A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>U.S. conterminous wall-to-wall anthropogenic land use trends (NWALT), 1974–2012</title></titles><pages>45-45</pages><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>948</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ds948</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Doyle, Thomas W.</author><author>Chivoiu, Bogdan</author><author>Enwright, Nicholas M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sea-level rise modeling handbook: resource guide for coastal land managers, engineers, and scientists</title></titles><pages>76-76</pages><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>1815</isbn><abstract>Global sea level is rising and may accelerate with continued fossil fuel consumption from industrial and population growth. In 2012, the U.S. Geological Survey conducted more than 30 training and feedback sessions with Federal, State, and nongovernmental organization (NGO) coastal managers and planners across the northern Gulf of Mexico coast to evaluate user needs, potential benefits, current scientific understanding, and utilization of resource aids and modeling tools focused on sea-level rise. In response to the findings from the sessions, this sea-level rise modeling handbook has been designed as a guide to the science and simulation models for understanding the dynamics and impacts of sea-level rise on coastal ecosystems. The review herein of decision-support tools and predictive models was compiled from the training sessions, from online research, and from publications. The purpose of this guide is to describe and categorize the suite of data, methods, and models and their design, structure, and application for hindcasting and forecasting the potential impacts of sea-level rise in coastal ecosystems. The data and models cover a broad spectrum of disciplines involving different designs and scales of spatial and temporal complexity for predicting environmental change and ecosystem response. These data and models have not heretofore been synthesized, nor have appraisals been made of their utility or limitations. Some models are demonstration tools for non-experts, whereas others require more expert capacity to apply for any given park, refuge, or regional application. A simplified tabular context has been developed to list and contrast a host of decision-support tools and models from the ecological, geological, and hydrological perspectives. Criteria were established to distinguish the source, scale, and quality of information input and geographic datasets; physical and biological constraints and relations; datum characteristics of water and land components; utility options for setting sea- level rise and climate change scenarios; and ease or difficulty 1U.S. Geological Survey. 2 University of Louisiana at Lafayette. of storing, displaying, or interpreting model output.

This study is set to evaluate how aspen distribution might shift in response to different climate-fire scenarios in a semi-arid montane landscape, and quantify the influence of fire regime along topoclimatic gradients. We used a novel integration of a forest landscape succession and disturbance model (LANDIS-II) with a fine-scale climatic water deficit approach to simulate dynamics of aspen and associated conifer and shrub species over the next 150 years under various climate-fire scenarios. Simulations suggest that many aspen stands could persist without fire for centuries under current climate conditions. However, a simulated 2-5 A degrees C increase in temperature caused a substantial reduction of aspen coverage at lower elevations and a modest increase at upper elevations, leading to an overall reduction of aspen range at the landscape level. Increasing fire activity may favor aspen increase at its upper elevation limits adjacent to coniferous forest, but may also favor reduction of aspen at lower elevation limits adjacent to xeric shrubland. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating fine-scale terrain effects on climatic water deficit and ecohydrology when modeling species distribution response to climate change. This modeling study suggests that climate mitigation and adaptation strategies that use fire would benefit from consideration of spatial context at landscape scales.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70157345</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Meyer, Marc D.</author><author>Roberts, Susan L.</author><author>Wills, Robin</author><author>Brooks, Matthew</author><author>Winford, Eric M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Principles of effective USA federal fire management plans</title><secondary-title>Fire Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Fire Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>59-83</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Wildland fire</keyword><keyword>Fire policy</keyword><keyword>Sierra nevada</keyword><keyword>Fire management plan</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1933-9747</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.4996/fireecology.1102059</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Federal fire management plans are essential implementation guides for the management of wildland fire on federal lands. Recent changes in federal fire policy implementation guidance and fire science information suggest the need for substantial changes in federal fire management plans of the United States. Federal land management agencies are also undergoing land management planning efforts that will initiate revision of fire management plans across the country. Using the southern Sierra Nevada as a case study, we briefly describe the underlying framework of fire management plans, assess their consistency with guiding principles based on current science information and federal policy guidance, and provide recommendations for the development of future fire management plans. Based on our review, we recommend that future fire management plans be: (1) consistent and compatible, (2) collaborative, (3) clear and comprehensive, (4) spatially and temporally scalable, (5) informed by the best available science, and (6) flexible and adaptive. In addition, we identify and describe several strategic guides or "tools" that can enhance these core principles and benefit future fire management plans in the following areas: planning and prioritization, science integration, climate change adaptation, partnerships, monitoring, education and communication, and applied fire management.

Increased fire activity on USFS lands was correlated with warmer and drier springs. Although this is consistent with recent global warming, we found an equally strong relationship between fire activity and climate in the first half of the 20th century. At lower elevations, warmer and drier conditions were not strongly tied to fire activity over the last 90 years, although prior-year precipitation was significant. It is hypothesised that the fire–climate relationship in forests is determined by climatic effects on spring and summer fuel moisture, with hotter and drier springs leading to a longer fire season and more extensive burning. In contrast, future fire activity in the foothills may be more dependent on rainfall patterns and their effect on the herbaceous fuel load. We predict spring and summer warming will have a significant impact on future fire regimes, primarily in higher-elevation forests. Lower elevation ecosystems are likely to be affected as much by global changes that directly involve land-use patterns as by climate change.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70140290</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Roberts, Susan L.</author><author>Kelt, Douglas A.</author><author>Van Wagtendonk, Jan W.</author><author>Miles, A.

The reintroduction of fire (e.g., prescribed fire, managed wildfire) is a critical management tool for protecting many frequent-fire forests against stand-replacing fires while restoring an essential ecological process. Understanding the effects of fire on forests and wildlife communities is important in natural resource planning efforts. Small mammals are key components of forest food webs and essential to ecosystem function. To investigate the relationship of fire to small mammal assemblages, we live trapped small mammals in 10 burned and 10 unburned forests over 2 years in the central Sierra Nevada, California. Small mammal abundance was higher in unburned forests, largely reflecting the greater proportion of closed-canopy species such as Glaucomys sabrinus in unburned forests. The most abundant species across the entire study area was the highly adaptable generalist species, Peromyscus maniculatus. Species diversity was similar between burned and unburned forests, but burned forests were characterized by greater habitat heterogeneity and higher small mammal species evenness. The use and reintroduction of fire to maintain a matrix of burn severities, including large patches of unburned refugia, creates a heterogeneous and resilient landscape that allows for fire-sensitive species to proliferate and, as such, may help maintain key ecological functions and diverse small mammal assemblages.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70156354</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brennan, Teresa J.</author><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effect of mastication and other mechanical treatments on fuel structure in chaparral</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</full-title></periodical><pages>949-963</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>7</issue><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1049-8001</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1071/WF14140</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Mechanical fuel treatments are a common pre-fire strategy for reducing wildfire hazard that alters fuel structure by converting live canopy fuels to a compacted layer of dead surface fuels. Current knowledge concerning their effectiveness, however, comes primarily from forest-dominated ecosystems. Our objectives were to quantify and compare changes in shrub-dominated chaparral following crushing, mastication, re-mastication and mastication-plus-burning treatments, and to assess treatment longevity. Results from analysis of variance (ANOVA) identified significant differences in all fuel components by treatment type, vegetation type and time since treatment. Live woody fuel components of height, cover and mass were positively correlated with time since treatment, whereas downed woody fuel components were negatively correlated. Herbaceous fuels, conversely, were not correlated, and exhibited a 5-fold increase in cover across treatment types in comparison to controls. Average live woody fuel recovery was 50% across all treatment and vegetation types. Differences in recovery between time-since-treatment years 1-8 ranged from 32-65% and exhibited significant positive correlations with time since treatment. These results suggest that treatment effectiveness is short term due to the rapid regrowth of shrubs in these systems and is compromised by the substantial increase in herbaceous fuels. Consequences of not having a full understanding of these treatments are serious and leave concern for their widespread use on chaparral-dominated landscapes.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70156719</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Varner, Johanna</author><author>Lambert, Mallory S.</author><author>Horns, Joshua J.</author><author>Laverty, Sean</author><author>Dizney, Laurie</author><author>Beever, Erik A.</author><author>Dearing, M.

Wildfires are increasing in frequency and severity as a result of climate change in many ecosystems; however, effects of altered disturbance regimes on wildlife remain poorly quantified. Here, we leverage an unexpected opportunity to investigate how fire affects the occupancy and abundance of a climate-sensitive habitat specialist, the American pika (Ochotona princeps). We determine the effects of a fire on microclimates within talus and explore habitat factors promoting persistence and abundance in fire-affected habitat. During the fire, temperatures in talus interstices remained below 19°C, suggesting that animals could have survived in situ. Within 2 years, pikas were widely distributed throughout burned areas and did not appear to be physiologically stressed at severely burned sites. Furthermore, pika densities were better predicted by topographic variables known to affect this species than by metrics of fire severity. This widespread distribution may reflect quick vegetation recovery and the fact that the fire did not alter the talus microclimates in the following years. Together, these results highlight the value of talus as a thermal refuge for small animals during and after fire. They also underscore the importance of further study in individual species' responses to typical and altered disturbance regimes.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70157235</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wu, Zhuoting</author><author>Middleton, Barry</author><author>Hetzler, Robert</author><author>Vogel, John</author><author>Dye, Dennis</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vegetation Burn Severity Mapping Using Landsat-8 and WorldView-2</title><secondary-title>Photogrammetric Engineering &amp; Remote Sensing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Photogrammetric Engineering &amp; Remote Sensing</full-title></periodical><pages>143-154</pages><volume>81</volume><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.14358/PERS.81.2.143</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We used remotely sensed data from the Landsat-8 and WorldView-2 satellites to estimate vegetation burn severity of the Creek Fire on the San Carlos Apache Reservation, where wildfire occurrences affect the Tribe’s crucial livestock and logging industries.

Many trout populations are limited to headwater streams where negative effects of predicted climate change, including reduced stream flow and increased risk of catastrophic fires, may further jeopardize their persistence. Headwater streams in steep terrain are especially susceptible to disturbance associated with postfire debris flows, which have led to local extirpation of trout populations in some systems. We conducted a reach-scale spatial analysis of debris-flow risk among 11 high-elevation watersheds of the Colorado Rocky Moun-tains occupied by isolated populations of Colorado River Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii pleuriticus). Stream reaches at high risk of disturbance by postfire debris flow were identified with the aid of a qualitative model based on 4 primary initiating and transport factors (hillslope gradient, flow accumulation pathways, channel gra-dient, and valley confinement). This model was coupled with a spatially continuous survey of trout distributions in these stream networks to assess the predicted extent of trout population disturbances related to debris flows. In the study systems, debris-flow potential was highest in the lower and middle reaches of most watersheds. Colorado River Cutthroat Trout occurred in areas of high postfire debris-flow risk, but they were never restricted to those areas. Postfire debris flows could extirpate trout from local reaches in these watersheds, but trout populations oc-cupy refugia that should allow recolonization of interconnected, downstream reaches. Specific results of our study may not be universally applicable, but our risk assessment approach can be applied to assess postfire debris-flow risk for stream reaches in other watersheds. Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii) have experienced declines in distribution and abundance throughout the western USA because of habitat fragmentation and degra-dation and interactions with nonnative species (Gresswell 1988, Behnke 1992, Young 1995). Extant Cutthroat Trout populations generally are confined to mid-to high-elevation streams (&gt;2500 m) with high gradients (Gresswell 1988) and often are isolated by natural or anthropogenic barriers to upstream movement (Kruse et al. 2001, Shepard et al. 2005). Large-scale patterns of habitat occupancy by Cutthroat Trout apparently result from the incursion of nonnative fish spe-cies and ubiquitous water development in downstream por-tions of occupied watersheds (Young 2008). Streams occu-pied by Cutthroat Trout are situated primarily on public lands, particularly those administered by the US Depart-ment of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (Rieman et al. 2003, Hirsch et al. 2013). A wide variety of land management activities, includ-ing overgrazing, heavy metal pollution, and depletion and diversion of water resources in the upper Colorado River basin, have affected streams occupied by Colorado River Cutthroat Trout (O. c. pleuriticus) (CRCT Coordination Team 2006). Some anthropogenic changes associated with land use (e.g., road culverts and irrigation diversions) have unintentionally isolated upstream populations of Colorado River Cutthroat Trout, thereby protecting them from</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/684094</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Mantgem, Elizabeth F.</author><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author><author>Witter, Marti</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Faunal responses to fire in chaparral and sage scrub in California, USA</title><secondary-title>Fire Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Fire Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>128-148</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire behavior</keyword><keyword>Chaparral</keyword><keyword>Sage scrub</keyword><keyword>Endogenous postfire recovery</keyword><keyword>Fauna</keyword><keyword>Recolonization</keyword><keyword>Refugia</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1933-9747</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.4996/fireecology.1103128</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Impact of fire on California shrublands has been well studied but nearly\nall of this work has focused on plant communities. Impact on and\nrecovery of the chaparral fauna has received only scattered attention;\nthis paper synthesizes what is known in this regard for the diversity of\nanimal taxa associated with California shrublands and outlines the\nprimary differences between plant and animal responses to fire. We\nevaluated the primary faunal modes of resisting fire effects in three\ncategories: 1) endogenous survival in a diapause or diapause-like stage,\n2) sheltering in place within unburned refugia, or 3) fleeing and\nrecolonizing. Utilizing these patterns in chaparral and sage scrub, as\nwell as some studies on animals in other mediterranean-climate\necosystems, we derived generalizations about how plants and animals\ndiffer in their responses to fire impacts and their postfire recovery.\nOne consequence of these differences is that variation in fire behavior\nhas a much greater potential to affect animals than plants. For example,\nplants recover from fire endogenously from soil-stored seeds and\nresprouts, so fire size plays a limited role in determining recovery\npatterns. However, animals that depend on recolonization of burned sites\nfrom metapopulations may be greatly affected by fire size. Animal\nrecolonization may also be greatly affected by regional land use\npatterns that affect colonization corridors, whereas such regional\nfactors play a minimal role in plant community recovery. Fire\ncharacteristics such as rate of spread and fire intensity do not appear\nto play an important role in determining patterns of chaparral and sage\nscrub plant recovery after fire. However, these fire behavior\ncharacteristics may have a profound role in determining survivorship of\nsome animal populations as slow-moving, smoldering combustion may limit\nsurvivorship of animals in burrows, whereas fast-moving, high intensity\nfires may affect survivorship of animals in aboveground refugia or those\nattempting to flee. Thus, fire regime characteristics may have a much\ngreater effect on postfire recovery of animal communities than plant\ncommunities in these shrubland ecosystems.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70160013</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Falke, Jeffrey A.</author><author>Flitcroft, Rebecca L.</author><author>Dunham, Jason B.</author><author>McNyset, Kristina M.</author><author>Hessburg, Paul F.</author><author>Reeves, Gordon H.</author><author>Marshall, C.

We used time-varying statistical models to evaluate if and how fire-climate relationships varied from 1902-2008, in one of the most flammable forested regions of the western U.S.A. Fire-danger and water-balance metrics yielded the best com- bination of calibration accuracy and predictive skill in modeling annual area burned. The strength of fire-climate relationships varied markedly at multi-decadal scales, with models explaining &lt; 40% to 88% of the variation in annual area burned. The early 20th century (1902-1942) and the most recent two decades (1985-2008) exhibited strong fire-climate relationships, with weaker relationships for much of the mid 20th century (1943-1984), coin- cident with diminished burning, less fire-conducive climate, and the initiation of modern fire fighting. Area burned and the strength of fire-climate relationships increased sharply in the mid 1980s, associated with increased temperatures and longer potential fire seasons. Unlike decades with high burning in the early 20th century, models developed using fire-cli- mate relationships from recent decades overpredicted area burned when applied to earlier periods. This amplified response of fire to climate is a signature of altered fire-climate-rela- tionships, and it implicates non-climatic factors in this recent shift. Changes in fuel structure and availability following 40+ yr of unusually low fire activity, and possibly land use, may have resulted in increased fire vulnerability beyond expectations from climatic factors alone. Our results highlight the potential for non-climatic factors to alter fire-climate relation- ships, and the need to account for such dynamics, through adaptable statistical or pro- cesses-based models, for accurately predicting future fire activity.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70159219</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sankey, Joel B</author><author>McVay, Jason C</author><author>Kreitler, Jason R</author><author>Hawbaker, Todd J</author><author>Vaillant, Nicole</author><author>Lowe, Scott</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predicting watershed post-fire sediment yield with the InVEST sediment retention model: Accuracy and uncertainties</title></titles><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70148363</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Peterson, Birgit</author><author>Nelson, Kurtis J.</author><author>Seielstad, Carl</author><author>Stoker, Jason</author><author>Jolly, W.

Remotely sensed data are invaluable for assessing these canopy characteristics over large areas; lidar data, in particular, are uniquely suited for quantifying three-dimensional canopy structure.Although lidar data are increasingly available, they have rarely been applied towildland fuelsmapping efforts, mostly due to two issues. First, the Landscape Fire and Resource Planning Tools (LANDFIRE) program, which has become the default source of large-scale fire behaviour modelling inputs for theUS, does not currently incorporate lidar data into the vegetation and fuel mapping process because spatially continuous lidar data are not available at the national scale. Second, while lidar data are available for many land management units across theUS, these data are underutilized for fire behaviour applications. This is partly due to a lack of local personnel trained to process and analyse lidar data. This investigation addresses these issues by developing the Creating Hybrid Structure from LANDFIRE/lidar Combinations (CHISLIC) tool.CHISLIC allows individuals to automatically generate a suite of vegetation structure and wildland fuel parameters from lidar data and infuse them into existing LANDFIRE data sets. CHISLIC will become available for wider distribution to the public through a partnership with the U.S. Forest Service’s Wildland Fire Assessment System (WFAS) and may be incorporated into the Wildland Fire Decision Support System (WFDSS) with additional design and testing. WFAS andWFDSS are the primary systems used to support tactical and strategic wildland fire management decisions. 1.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70188036</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shryock, Daniel F</author><author>Esque, Todd C</author><author>Chen, Felicia C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A 30-year chronosequence of burned areas in Arizona: effects of wildfires on vegetation in Sonoran Desert Tortoise (Gopherus morafkai) habitats</title></titles><pages>71-71</pages><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2015-1060</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20151060</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reker, Ryan</author><author>Sohl, Terry L</author><author>Gallant, Alisa L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using Landsat imagery to detect, monitor, and project net landscape change</title><secondary-title>All Bird Bulletin</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>All Bird Bulletin</full-title></periodical><pages>13-17</pages><volume>Spring 201</volume><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70187761</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Symstad, Amy J</author><author>Smith, Anine T</author><author>Newton, Wesley E</author><author>Knapp, Alan K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Potential nitrogen critical loads for northern Great Plains grassland vegetation</title></titles><pages>72-72</pages><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Fort Collins, CO</pub-location><isbn>NPS/NGPN/NRR - 2015/989</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70155195</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Beyers, Jan L</author><author>Pyke, David A</author><author>Wirth, Troy</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Synthesis of current knowledge on post-fire seeding for soil stabilization and invasive species control</title></titles><pages>1-15</pages><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70185272</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bowen, Lizabeth</author><author>Miles, A.

Little is known, however, about the more subtle toxicological effects of wildfires, particularly in downstream marine or downwind locations from the wildfire perimeter. These down-current effects may be just as substantial as those effects within the perimeter. We used gene transcription technology, a sensitive indicator of immunological perturbation, to study the effects of the 2008 Basin Complex Fire on the California coast on a sentinel marine species, the sea otter (Enhydra lutris). We captured sea otters in 2008 (3 mo after the Basin Complex Fire was controlled) and 2009 (15 mo after the Basin Complex Fire was controlled) in the adjacent nearshore environment near Big Sur, California. Gene responses were distinctly different between Big Sur temporal groups, signifying detoxification of PAHs, possible associated response to potential malignant transformation, and suppression of immune function as the primary responses of sea otters to fire in 2008 compared to those captured in 2009. In general, gene transcription patterns in the 2008 sea otters were indicative of molecular reactions to organic exposure, malignant transformation, and decreased ability to respond to pathogens that seemed to consistent with short-term hydrocarbon exposure.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70122440</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Karacan, C.

Coal seam reservoir simulation is one of the most effective ways to help with these two main objectives. As in all modeling and simulation studies, how the reservoir is defined and whether observed productions can be predicted are important considerations. Using geostatistical realizations as spatial maps of different coal reservoir properties is a more realistic approach than assuming uniform properties across the field. In fact, this approach can help with simultaneous history matching of multiple wellbores to enhance the confidence in spatial models of different coal properties that are pertinent to degasification. The problem that still remains is the uncertainty in geostatistical simulations originating from the partial sampling of the seam that does not properly reflect the stochastic nature of coal property realizations. Stochastic simulations and using individual realizations, rather than E-type, make evaluation of uncertainty possible. This work is an advancement over Karacan et al. (2014) in the sense of assessing uncertainty that stems from geostatistical maps. In this work, we batched 100 individual realizations of 10 coal properties that were randomly generated to create 100 bundles and used them in 100 separate coal seam reservoir simulations for simultaneous history matching. We then evaluated the history matching errors for each bundle and defined the single set of realizations that would minimize the error for all wells. We further compared the errors with those of E-type and the average realization of the best matches. Unlike in Karacan et al. (2014), which used E-type maps and average of quantile maps, using these 100 bundles created 100 different history match results from separate simulations, and distributions of results for in-place gas quantity, for example, from which uncertainty in coal property realizations could be evaluated. The study helped to determine the realization bundle that consisted of the spatial maps of coal properties, which resulted in minimum error. In addition, it was shown that both E-type and the average of realizations that gave the best match for invidual approximated the same properties resonably. Moreover, the determined realization bundle showed that the study field initially had 151.5 million m3 (cubic meter) of gas and 1.04 million m3 water in the coal, corresponding to Q90 of the entire range of probability for gas and close to Q75 for water. In 2013, in-place fluid amounts decreased to 138.9 million m3 and 0.997 million m3 for gas and water, respectively.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70142328</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Drummond, Mark A.</author><author>Stier, Michael P.</author><author>Auch, Roger F.</author><author>Taylor, Janis L.</author><author>Griffith, Glenn E.</author><author>Riegle, Jodi L.</author><author>Hester, David J.</author><author>Soulard, Christopher E.</author><author>McBeth, Jamie L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessing Landscape Change and Processes of Recurrence, Replacement, and Recovery in the Southeastern Coastal Plains, USA</title><secondary-title>Environmental Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Management</full-title></periodical><pages>1252-1271</pages><volume>56</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Coastal plain</keyword><keyword>Ecoregion</keyword><keyword>Land recovery</keyword><keyword>Land-use process</keyword><keyword>Landscape change</keyword><keyword>Silviculture</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0364152X (ISSN)</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00267-015-0574-1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The processes of landscape change are complex, exhibiting spatial variability as well as linear, cyclical, and reversible characteristics. To better understand the various processes that cause transformation, a data aggregation, validation, and attribution approach was developed and applied to an analysis of the Southeastern Coastal Plains (SECP). The approach integrates information from available national land-use, natural disturbance, and land-cover data to efficiently assess spatially-specific changes and causes. Between 2001 and 2006, the processes of change affected 7.8% of the SECP but varied across small-scale ecoregions. Processes were placed into a simple conceptual framework to explicitly identify the type and direction of change based on three general characteristics: replacement, recurrence, and recovery. Replacement processes, whereby a land use or cover is supplanted by a new land use, including urbanization and agricultural expansion, accounted for approximately 15% of the extent of change. Recurrent processes that contribute to cyclical changes in land cover, including forest harvest/replanting and fire, accounted for 83%. Most forest cover changes were recurrent, while the extents of recurrent silviculture and forest replacement processes such as urbanization far exceeded forest recovery processes. The total extent of landscape recovery, from prior land use to natural or semi-natural vegetation cover, accounted for less than 3% of change. In a region of complex change, increases in transitory grassland and shrubland covers were caused by large-scale intensive plantation silviculture and small-scale activities including mining reclamation. Explicit identification of the process types and dynamics presented here may improve the understanding of land-cover change and landscape trajectory.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70159159</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huang, Shengli</author><author>Dahal, Devendra</author><author>Liu, Heping</author><author>Jin, Suming</author><author>Young, Claudia</author><author>Li, Shuang</author><author>Liu, Shuguang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spatiotemporal variation of surface shortwave forcing from fire-induced albedo change in interior Alaska</title><secondary-title>Canadian Journal of Forest Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canadian Journal of Forest Research</full-title></periodical><pages>276-285</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/cjfr-2014-0309</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The albedo change caused by fires and the subsequent succession is spatially heterogeneous, leading to the need to assess the spatiotemporal variation of surface shortwave forcing (SSF) as a component to quantify the climate impacts of high-latitude fires.

Combining the fire-caused albedo change from the 2001–2010 fires in interior Alaska and the monthly surface incoming solar radiation, we examined the spatiotemporal variation of SSF in the early successional stage of approximately 10 years. Our results showed that although postfire albedo generally increased in fall, winter, and spring, some burned areas could show an albedo decrease during these seasons.

However, empirical studies of the effects of spatial structure on plant species richness have found inconsistent results, suggesting that more comprehensive approaches are needed. In this study, we asked how landscape structure affects total plant species richness and the richness of a guild of specialized plants in a multivariate context. We sampled herbaceous plant communities at 56 dolomite glades (insular, fire-adapted grasslands) across the Missouri Ozarks, and used structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze the relative importance of landscape structure, soil resource availability, and fire history for plant communities.

The proliferation of non-native annual grasses has increased wildfire frequency and extent in recent decades and continues to accelerate the conversion of tortoise habitat across the Mojave Desert. Immediate changes to vegetation are expected to reduce quality of critical habitat, yet whether tortoises will use burned and recovering habitat differently from intact unburned habitat is unknown. We compared movement patterns, home-range size, behavior, microhabitat use, reproduction, and survival for adult desert tortoises located in, and adjacent to, burned habitat to understand how tortoises respond to recovering burned habitat. Approximately 45% of home ranges in the post-fire environment contained burned habitat, and numerous observations (n = 12,223) corroborated tortoise use of both habitat types (52% unburned, 48% burned). Tortoises moved progressively deeper into burned habitat during the first 5 years following the fire, frequently foraging in burned habitats that had abundant annual plants, and returning to adjacent unburned habitat for cover provided by intact perennial vegetation. However, by years 6 and 7, the live cover of the short-lived herbaceous perennial desert globemallow (Sphaeralcea ambigua) that typically re-colonizes burned areas declined, resulting in a contraction of tortoise movements from the burned areas. Health and egg production were similar between burned and unburned areas indicating that tortoises were able to acquire necessary resources using both areas. This study documents that adult Mojave desert tortoises continue to use habitat burned once by wildfire. Thus, continued management of this burned habitat may contribute toward the recovery of the species in the face of many sources of habitat loss. Published 2015.

We analyzed the relationships between fire–weather conditions during the main fire season and antecedent water-balance conditions and fires in two Mediterranean-type regions with contrasted management histories: five southern countries of the European Union (EUMED)(all fires); the Pacific western coast of the USA (California and Oregon, PWUSA)(national forest fires). Total number of fires (≥1 ha), number of large fires (≥100 ha) and area burned were related to mean seasonal fire weather index (FWI), number of days over the 90th percentile of the FWI, and to the standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI) from the preceding 3 (spring) or 8 (autumn through spring) months. Calculations were made at three spatial aggregations in each area, and models related first-difference (year-to-year change) of fires and FWI/climate variables to minimize autocorrelation. An increase in mean seasonal FWI resulted in increases in the three fire variables across spatial scales in both regions. SPEI contributed little to explain fires, with few exceptions. Negative water-balance (dry) conditions from autumn through spring (SPEI8) were generally more important than positive conditions (moist) in spring (SPEI3), both of which contributed positively to fires. The R2 of the models generally improved with increasing area of aggregation. For total number of fires and area burned, the R2 of the models tended to decrease with increasing mean seasonal FWI. Thus, fires were more susceptible to change with climate variability in areas with less amenable conditions for fires (lower FWI) than in areas with higher mean FWI values. The relationships were similar in both regions, albeit weaker in PWUSA, probably due to the wider latitudinal gradient covered in PWUSA than in EUMED. The large variance explained by some of the models indicates that large-scale seasonal forecast could help anticipating fire activity in the investigated areas.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70160055</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Harden, Tessa M.</author><author>O'Connor, Jim E.</author><author>Driscoll, Daniel G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Late Holocene flood probabilities in the Black Hills, South Dakota with emphasis on the Medieval Climate Anomaly</title><secondary-title>Catena</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Catena</full-title></periodical><pages>62-68</pages><volume>130</volume><keywords><keyword>Black Hills</keyword><keyword>Late Holocene</keyword><keyword>Medieval Climate Anomaly</keyword><keyword>Paleoflood</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.catena.2014.10.002</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A stratigraphic record of 35 large paleofloods and four large historical floods during the last 2000. years for four basins in the Black Hills of South Dakota reveals three long-term flooding episodes, identified using probability distributions, at A.D.: 120-395, 900-1290, and 1410 to present.

Because of near-daily global coverage, MODIS data are beneficial to applications that require timely information about vegetation condition related to drought, flooding, or fire danger. Rapid satellite data streams in operational applications have clear benefits for monitoring vegetation, especially when information can be delivered as fast as changing surface conditions. An “expedited” processing system called “eMODIS” operated by the U.S. Geological Survey provides rapid MODIS surface reflectance data to operational applications in less than 24 h offering tailored, consistently-processed information products that complement standard MODIS products. We assessed eMODIS quality and consistency by comparing to standard MODIS data. Only land data with known high quality were analyzed in a central U.S. study area. When compared to standard MODIS (MOD/MYD09Q1), the eMODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) maintained a strong, significant relationship to standard MODIS NDVI, whether from morning (Terra) or afternoon (Aqua) orbits. The Aqua eMODIS data were more prone to noise than the Terra data, likely due to differences in the internal cloud mask used in MOD/MYD09Q1 or compositing rules. Post-processing temporal smoothing decreased noise in eMODIS data.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70178118</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shinneman, D.J.</author><author>Halford, A.S.</author><author>Howell, C.</author><author>Krasnow, K.D.</author><author>Strand, E.K.</author><author>Chambers, Jeanne</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Management of Aspen in a Changing Environment</title></titles><pages>1-8</pages><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sagegrouseinitiative.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Aspen-in-a-Changing-Environment-Grt-Basin-fs-12.pdf</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pyke, DA</author><author>Chambers, JC</author><author>Pellant, Mike</author><author>Knick, ST</author><author>Miller, R.F.</author><author>Beck, J.L.</author><author>Doescher, PS</author><author>Schupp, EW</author><author>Roundy, BA</author><author>Brunson, M</author><author>McIver, JD</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Restoration Handbook for Sagebrush Steppe Ecosystems with Emphasis on Greater Sage-Grouse Habitat — Part 1 .

The current document summarizes the literature and synthesizes core concepts that are necessary for a practitioner/manager to apply tools to help make landscape and site-specific decisions. Landscape-level decision tools are designed to help managers prioritize resource allocation among multiple potential restoration projects for achieving the greatest benefit at the landscape level. We are examining how restoration of sagebrush steppe can benefit habitat for sage-grouse because of the timeliness of the upcoming decision to list sage-grouse under the Endangered Species Act. In addition, we are emphasizing greater sage-grouse because they are an umbrella species within this region where other wildlife species that depend on resilient sagebrush grassland communities will benefit from this restoration. There are additional objectives for restoration of sagebrush grasslands beyond greater sage-grouse habitat, for example, improving rangeland biological diversity, reducing and controlling invasive plant dominance, and improving the stability of livestock forage. For site-level decisions, managers will decide to use passive or active restoration techniques and will learn how to select appropriate plant species and techniques for restoration of sagebrush ecosystems. Landscape prioritization tools and project-level restoration tools use concepts of ecosystem resilience to disturbances and resistance to invasion by annual grasses. We stress that these invasions are the largest threat to sagebrush steppe ecosystems and that restoration, if successful, is a means for reducing this threat and improving greater sage-grouse habitat. Decisions at the landscape- and site-level will be enhanced through knowledge gained by understanding and applying concepts presented in this document.</abstract><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/cir1416</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brooks, Matthew L.</author><author>Matchett, John R.</author><author>Shinneman, Douglas J.</author><author>Coates, Peter S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fire Patterns in the Range of the Greater Sage-Grouse , 1984 – 2013 — Implications for Conservation and Management</title></titles><pages>1984-2013</pages><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2015-1167</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20151167</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zeigenfuss, Linda C</author><author>Johnson, Therese L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Monitoring of vegetation response to elk population and habitat management in Rocky Mountain National Park, 2008–14</title></titles><pages>50-50</pages><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2015-1216</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20151216</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Telis, Pamela A</author><author>Xie, Zhixiao</author><author>Liu, Zhongwei</author><author>Li, Yingru</author><author>Conrads, Paul A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Everglades Depth Estimation Network (EDEN) surface-water model, version 2</title></titles><pages>54-54</pages><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2014-5209</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20145209</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bixby, Rebecca J.</author><author>Cooper, Scott D.</author><author>Gresswell, Robert E.</author><author>Brown, Lee E.</author><author>Dahm, Clifford N.</author><author>Dwire, Kathleen A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fire effects on aquatic ecosystems: an assessment of the current state of the science</title><secondary-title>Freshwater Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Freshwater Science</full-title></periodical><pages>1340-1350</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2161-9549</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1086/684073</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fire is a prevalent feature of many landscapes and has numerous and complex effects on geological, hydrological, ecological, and economic systems. In some regions, the frequency and intensity of wildfire have increased in recent years and are projected to escalate with predicted climatic and landuse changes. In addition, prescribed burns continue to be used in many parts of the world to clear vegetation for development projects, encourage desired vegetation, and reduce fuel loads. Given the prevalence of fire on the landscape, authors of papers in this special series examine the complexities of fire as a disturbance shaping freshwater ecosystems and highlight the state of the science. These papers cover key aspects of fire effects that range from vegetation loss and recovery in watersheds to effects on hydrology and water quality with consequences for communities (from algae to fish), food webs, and ecosystem processes (e.g., organic matter subsidies, nutrient cycling) across a range of scales. The results presented in this special series of articles expand our knowledge of fire effects in different biomes, water bodies, and geographic regions, encompassing aquatic population, community, and eco-system responses. In this overview, we summarize each paper and emphasize its contributions to knowledge on fire ecology and freshwater ecosystems. This overview concludes with a list of 7 research foci that are needed to further our knowledge of fire effects on aquatic ecosystems, including research on: 1) additional biomes and geographic regions; 2) additional habitats, including wetlands and lacustrine ecosystems; 3) different fire sever-ities, sizes, and spatial configurations; and 4) additional response variables (e.g., ecosystem processes) 5) over long (&gt;5 y) time scales 6) with more rigorous study designs and data analyses, and 7) consideration of the effects of fire management practices and policies on aquatic ecosystems.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/684073</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>DeGraff, Jerome V.</author><author>Cannon, Susan</author><author>Gartner, Joseph E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Timing of Susceptibility to Post-fire Debris Flows in the Western USA</title><secondary-title>Environmental &amp; Engineering Geoscience</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental &amp; Engineering Geoscience</full-title></periodical><pages>1078-7275.EEG-1677</pages><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1078-7275</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2113/EEG-1677</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Watersheds Recently Burned by Wildfires Can Have An Increased Susceptibility to debris Flow, Although Little is Known About How Long This Susceptibility Persists, and How It changes Over Time.

In fire-dependent ecosystems, predicting this response requires a focus on how these drivers will impact fire regimes. Here, we use scenarios of climate change, urbanization and management to simulate the future dynamics of the critically endangered and fire-dependent longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem. We investigated how climate change and urbanization will affect the ecosystem, and whether the two conservation goals of a 135% increase in total longleaf area and a doubling of fire-maintained open-canopy habitat can be achieved in the face of these drivers. Our results show that while climatic warming had little effect on the wildfire regime, and thus on longleaf pine dynamics, urban growth led to an 8% reduction in annual wildfire area. The management scenarios we tested increase the ecosystem's total extent by up to 62% and result in expansion of open-canopy longleaf by as much as 216%, meeting one of the two conservation goals for the ecosystem. We find that both conservation goals for this ecosystem, which is climate-resilient but vulnerable to urbanization, are only attainable if a greater focus is placed on restoration of non-longleaf areas as opposed to maintaining existing longleaf stands. Our approach demonstrates the importance of accounting for multiple relevant anthropogenic threats in an ecosystem-specific context in order to facilitate more effective management actions.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70175295</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Farzan, Shahla</author><author>Young, Derek J.N.</author><author>Dedrick, Allison G.</author><author>Hamilton, Matthew</author><author>Porse, Erik C.</author><author>Coates, Peter S.</author><author>Sampson, Gabriel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Western Juniper Management: Assessing Strategies for Improving Greater Sage-grouse Habitat and Rangeland Productivity</title><secondary-title>Environmental Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Management</full-title></periodical><pages>675-683</pages><volume>56</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Centrocercus urophasianus</keyword><keyword>Juniperus occidentalis subsp. occidentalis</keyword><keyword>Multi-objective management</keyword><keyword>Optimization modeling</keyword><keyword>Resource management</keyword><keyword>U.S. Endangered Species Act</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00267-015-0521-1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis subsp. occidentalis) range expansion into sagebrush steppe ecosystems has affected both native wildlife and economic livelihoods across western North America. The potential listing of the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) under the U.S. Endangered Species Act has spurred a decade of juniper removal efforts, yet limited research has evaluated program effectiveness. We used a multi-objective spatially explicit model to identify optimal juniper removal sites in Northeastern California across weighted goals for ecological (sage-grouse habitat) and economic (cattle forage production) benefits. We also extended the analysis through alternative case scenarios that tested the effects of coordination among federal agencies, budgetary constraints, and the use of fire as a juniper treatment method. We found that sage-grouse conservation and forage production goals are somewhat complementary, but the extent of complementary benefits strongly depends on spatial factors and management approaches. Certain management actions substantially increase achievable benefits, including agency coordination and the use of prescribed burns to remove juniper. Critically, our results indicate that juniper management strategies designed to increase cattle forage do not necessarily achieve measurable sage-grouse benefits, underscoring the need for program evaluation and monitoring.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70156024</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schwartz, Mark W.</author><author>Butt, Nathalie</author><author>Dolanc, Christopher R.</author><author>Holguin, Andrew</author><author>Moritz, Max A.</author><author>North, Malcolm P.</author><author>Safford, Hugh D.</author><author>Stephenson, Nathan L.</author><author>Thorne, James H.</author><author>van Mantgem, Phillip J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Increasing elevation of fire in the Sierra Nevada and implications for forest change</title><secondary-title>Ecosphere</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecosphere</full-title></periodical><pages>art121-art121</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>7</issue><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2150-8925</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1890/ES15-00003.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fire in high-elevation forest ecosystems can have severe impacts on forest structure, function and biodiversity. Using a 105-year data set, we found increasing elevation extent of fires in the Sierra Nevada, and pose five hypotheses to explain this pattern. Beyond the recognized pattern of increasing fire frequency in the Sierra Nevada since the late 20th century, we find that the upper elevation extent of those fires has also been increasing. Factors such as fire season climate and fuel build up are recognized potential drivers of changes in fire regimes. Patterns of warming climate and increasing stand density are consistent with both the direction and magnitude of increasing elevation of wildfire. Reduction in high elevation wildfire suppression and increasing ignition frequencies may also contribute to the observed pattern. Historical biases in fire reporting are recognized, but not likely to explain the observed patterns. The four plausible mechanistic hypotheses (changes in fire management, climate, fuels, ignitions) are not mutually exclusive, and likely have synergistic interactions that may explain the observed changes. Irrespective of mechanism, the observed pattern of increasing occurrence of fire in these subalpine forests may have significant impacts on their resilience to changing climatic conditions.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://doi.wiley.com/10.1890/ES15-00003.1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tadesse, Tsegaye</author><author>Wardlow, Brian D.</author><author>Brown, Jesslyn F.</author><author>Svoboda, Mark D.</author><author>Hayes, Michael J.</author><author>Fuchs, Brian</author><author>Gutzmer, Denise</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessing the vegetation condition impacts of the 2011 drought across the U.S. southern great plains using the vegetation drought response index (VegDRI)</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology</full-title></periodical><pages>153-169</pages><volume>54</volume><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1558-8424</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JAMC-D-14-0048.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The vegetation drought response index (VegDRI), which combines traditional climate- and satellite-based approaches for assessing vegetation conditions, offers new insights into assessing the impacts of drought from local to regional scales. In 2011, the U.S. southern Great Plains, which includes Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, was plagued by moderate to extreme drought that was intensified by an extended period of record-breaking heat. The 2011 drought presented an ideal case study to evaluate the performance of VegDRI in characterizing developing drought conditions. Assessment of the spatiotemporal drought patterns represented in the VegDRI maps showed that the severity and patterns of the drought across the region corresponded well to the record warm temperatures and much-below-normal precipitation reported by the National Climatic Data Center and the sectoral drought impacts documented by the Drought Impact Reporter (DIR). VegDRI values and maps also showed the evolution of the drought signal before the Las Conchas Fire (the largest fire in New Mexico's history). Reports in the DIR indicated that the 2011 drought had major adverse impacts on most rangeland and pastures in Texas and Oklahoma, resulting in total direct losses of more than $12 billion associated with crop, livestock, and timber production. These severe impacts on vegetation were depicted by the VegDRI at subcounty, state, and regional levels. This study indicates that the VegDRI maps can be used with traditional drought indicators and other in situ measures to help producers and government officials with various management decisions, such as justifying disaster assistance, assessing fire risk, and identifying locations to move livestock for grazing.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70188039</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Syphard, Alexandra D.</author><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Location, timing and extent of wildfire vary by cause of ignition</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</full-title></periodical><pages>37-47</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1071/WF14024</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The increasing extent of wildfires has prompted investigation into alternative fire management approaches to complement the traditional strategies of fire suppression and fuels manipulation. Wildfire prevention through ignition reduction is an approach with potential for success, but ignitions result from a variety of causes. If some ignition sources result in higher levels of area burned, then ignition prevention programmes could be optimised to target these distributions in space and time. We investigated the most common ignition causes in two southern California sub-regions, where humans are responsible for more than 95% of all fires, and asked whether these causes exhibited distinct spatial or intra-annual temporal patterns, or resulted in different extents of fire in 10–29-year periods, depending on sub-region. Different ignition causes had distinct spatial patterns and those that burned the most area tended to occur in autumn months. Both the number of fires and area burned varied according to cause of ignition, but the cause of the most numerous fires was not always the cause of the greatest area burned. In both sub-regions, power line ignitions were one of the top two causes of area burned: the other major causes were arson in one sub-region and power equipment in the other. Equipment use also caused the largest number of fires in both sub-regions. These results have important implications for understanding why, where and how ignitions are caused, and in turn, how to develop strategies to prioritise and focus fire prevention efforts. Fire extent has increased tremendously in southern California, and because most fires are caused by humans, ignition reduction offers a potentially powerful management strategy, especially if optimised to reflect the distinct spatial and temporal distributions in different ignition causes.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70140351</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baughman, Carson A.</author><author>Mann, Daniel H.</author><author>Verbyla, David L.</author><author>Kunz, Michael L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Soil surface organic layers in Arctic Alaska: Spatial distribution, rates of formation, and microclimatic effects</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research G: Biogeosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research G: Biogeosciences</full-title></periodical><pages>1150-1164</pages><volume>120</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>permafrost</keyword><keyword>chronosequence</keyword><keyword>ground temperature</keyword><keyword>soil organics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2169-8961</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2015JG002983</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Organic layers of living and dead vegetation cover the ground surface in&#xD;many permafrost landscapes and play important roles in ecosystem&#xD;processes. These soil surface organic layers (SSOLs) store large amounts&#xD;of carbon and buffer the underlying permafrost and its contained carbon&#xD;from changes in aboveground climate. Understanding the dynamics of SSOLs&#xD;is a prerequisite for predicting how permafrost and carbon stocks will&#xD;respond to warming climate. Here we ask three questions about SSOLs in a&#xD;representative area of the Arctic Foothills region of northern Alaska:&#xD;(1) What environmental factors control the thickness of SSOLs and the&#xD;carbon they store? (2) How long do SSOLs take to develop on newly&#xD;stabilized point bars? (3) How do SSOLs affect temperature in the&#xD;underlying ground? Results show that SSOL thickness and distribution&#xD;correlate with elevation, drainage area, vegetation productivity, and&#xD;incoming solar radiation. A multiple regression model based on these&#xD;correlations can simulate spatial distribution of SSOLs and estimate the&#xD;organic carbon stored there. SSOLs develop within a few decades after a&#xD;new, sandy, geomorphic surface stabilizes but require 500-700years to&#xD;reach steady state thickness. Mature SSOLs lower the growing season&#xD;temperature and mean annual temperature of the underlying mineral soil&#xD;by 8 and 3 degrees C, respectively. We suggest that the proximate&#xD;effects of warming climate on permafrost landscapes now covered by SSOLs&#xD;will occur indirectly via climate's effects on the frequency, extent,&#xD;and severity of disturbances like fires and landslides that disrupt the&#xD;SSOLs and interfere with their protection of the underlying permafrost.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70156876</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McNally, Amy</author><author>Husak, Gregory J.</author><author>Brown, Molly</author><author>Carroll, Mark</author><author>Funk, Chris</author><author>Yatheendradas, Soni</author><author>Arsenault, Kristi</author><author>Peters-Lidard, Christa</author><author>Verdin, James P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Calculating Crop Water Requirement Satisfaction in the West Africa Sahel with Remotely Sensed Soil Moisture</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hydrometeorology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hydrometeorology</full-title></periodical><pages>295-305</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JHM-D-14-0049.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>AbstractThe Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission will provide soil moisture data with unprecedented accuracy, resolution, and coverage, enabling models to better track agricultural drought and estimate yields.

The purpose of this study was to project the spatial and temporal aspects of carbon storage in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) under these changes from 2006 to 2050. We selected three emission scenarios and produced simulations with the CENTURY model using three General Circulation Models (GCMs) for each scenario. We also incorporated projected land use change and fire occurrence into the carbon accounting. RESULTS: The three GCMs showed increases in maximum and minimum temperature, but precipitation projections varied among GCMs. Total ecosystem carbon increased steadily from 7,942 gC/m(2) in 2006 to 10,234 gC/m(2) in 2050 with an annual rate increase of 53 gC/m(2)/year. About 56.6% and 27% of the increasing rate was attributed to total live carbon and total soil carbon, respectively. Net Primary Production (NPP) increased slightly from 260 gC/m(2)/year in 2006 to 310 gC/m(2)/year in 2050 with an annual rate increase of 1.22 gC/m(2)/year. Forest clear-cutting and fires resulted in direct carbon removal; however, the rate was low at 2.44 gC/m(2)/year during 2006-2050. The area of clear-cutting and wildfires in the GYE would account for 10.87% of total forested area during 2006-2050, but the predictive simulations demonstrated different spatial distributions in national forests and national parks. CONCLUSIONS: The GYE is a carbon sink during 2006-2050. The capability of vegetation is almost double that of soil in terms of sequestering extra carbon. Clear-cutting and wildfires in GYE will affect 10.87% of total forested area, but direct carbon removal from clear-cutting and fires is 109.6 gC/m(2), which accounts for only 1.2% of the mean ecosystem carbon level of 9,056 gC/m(2), and thus is not significant.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.cbmjournal.com/content/10/1/7</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Briggs, Jennifer S.</author><author>Hawbaker, Todd J.</author><author>Vandendriesche, Don</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Resilience of ponderosa and lodgepole pine forests to mountain pine beetle disturbance and limited regeneration</title><secondary-title>Forest Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forest Science</full-title></periodical><pages>689-702</pages><volume>61</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Ponderosa pine</keyword><keyword>Colorado</keyword><keyword>Regeneration</keyword><keyword>Lodgepole pine</keyword><keyword>Forest vegetation simulator</keyword><keyword>Mountain pine beetle</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>August 2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0015-749X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.5849/forsci.14-192</electronic-resource-num><abstract>After causing widespread mortality in lodgepole pine forests in North America, the mountain pine beetle (MPB) has recently also affected ponderosa pine, an alternate host species that may have different levels of resilience to this disturbance. We collected field data in ponderosa pine- and lodgepole pine-dominated forests attacked by MPB in Colorado and then simulated stand growth over 200 years using the Forest Vegetation Simulator. We compared scenarios of no disturbance with scenarios of MPB-caused mortality, both with and without regeneration. Results indicated that basal area and tree density recovered to predisturbance levels relatively rapidly (within 1–8 decades) in both forest types. However, convergence of the disturbed conditions with simulated undisturbed conditions took longer (12–20+ decades) and was delayed by the absence of regeneration. In MPB-affected ponderosa pine forests without regeneration, basal area did not converge with undisturbed conditions within 200 years, implying lower resilience in this ecosystem. Surface fuels accumulated rapidly in both forest types after MPB-induced mortality, remaining high for 3–6 decades in simulations. Our results suggest that future patterns of succession, regeneration, fuel loading, climate, and disturbance interactions over long time periods should be considered in management strategies addressing MPB effects in either forest type, but particularly in ponderosa pine. © 2015 Society of American Foresters.

This interaction was a result\nof projected WUI expansion into regions of higher wildfire risk than\nexisting WUI.\nThe human footprint will continue to expand into wildland areas and must\nbe considered along with climate effects when assessing the impacts of\nchanging fire regimes in future landscapes.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10980-015-0222-4</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Allen, Craig D.</author><author>Breshears, David D.</author><author>McDowell, Nate G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On underestimation of global vulnerability to tree mortality and forest die-off from hotter drought in the Anthropocene</title><secondary-title>Ecosphere</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecosphere</full-title></periodical><pages>art129-art129</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Climate change</keyword><keyword>Drought</keyword><keyword>Forest die-off</keyword><keyword>Tree mortality</keyword><keyword>CO2fertilization</keyword><keyword>Forests</keyword><keyword>Carbon starvation</keyword><keyword>ESA centennial paper</keyword><keyword>Extreme events</keyword><keyword>Hydraulic failure</keyword><keyword>Insect pests</keyword><keyword>Pathogens</keyword><keyword>Woodlands</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>August 2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2150-8925</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1890/ES15-00203.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Patterns, mechanisms, projections, and consequences of tree mortality and associated broad-scale forest die-off due to drought accompanied by warmer temperatures—''hotter drought'', an emerging characteristic of the Anthropocene—are the focus of rapidly expanding literature. Despite recent observational, experimental, and modeling studies suggesting increased vulnerability of trees to hotter drought and associated pests and pathogens, substantial debate remains among research, management and policy-making communities regarding future tree mortality risks. We summarize key mortality-relevant findings, differentiating between those implying lesser versus greater levels of vulnerability. Evidence suggesting lesser vulnerability includes forest benefits of elevated [CO 2 ] and increased water-use efficiency; observed and modeled increases in forest growth and canopy greening; widespread increases in woody-plant biomass, density, and extent; compensatory physiological, morphological, and genetic mechanisms; dampening ecological feedbacks; and potential mitigation by forest management. In contrast, recent studies document more rapid mortality under hotter drought due to negative tree physiological responses and accelerated biotic attacks. Additional evidence suggesting greater vulnerability includes rising background mortality rates; projected increases in drought frequency, intensity, and duration; limitations of vegetation models such as inadequately represented mortality processes; warming feedbacks from die-off; and wildfire synergies. Grouping these findings we identify ten contrasting perspectives that shape the vulnerability debate but have not been discussed collectively. We also present a set of global vulnerability drivers that are known with high confidence: (1) droughts eventually occur everywhere; (2) warming produces hotter droughts; (3) atmospheric moisture demand increases nonlinearly with temperature during drought; (4) mortality can occur faster in hotter drought, consistent with fundamental physiology; (5) shorter droughts occur more frequently than longer droughts and can become lethal under warming, increasing the frequency of lethal drought nonlinearly; and (6) mortality happens rapidly relative to growth intervals needed for forest recovery. These high-confidence drivers, in concert with research supporting greater vulnerability perspectives, support an overall viewpoint of greater forest vulnerability globally. We surmise that mortality vulnerability is being discounted in part due to difficulties in predicting threshold responses to extreme climate events. Given the profound ecological and societal implications of underestimating global vulnerability to hotter drought, we highlight urgent challenges for research, management, and policy-making communities.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://doi.wiley.com/10.1890/ES15-00203.1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Murphy, Sheila F</author><author>Writer, Jeffrey H</author><author>Mccleskey, R Blaine</author><author>Martin, Deborah A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Corrigendum : The role of precipitation type , intensity , and spatial distribution in source water quality after wild fi re ( 2015 Environ .</title><secondary-title>Environmental Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>84007-84007</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>climate change</keyword><keyword>wildfire</keyword><keyword>water quality</keyword><keyword>forests</keyword><keyword>landscape disturbance</keyword><keyword>North American Monsoon</keyword><keyword>rainfall intensity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1088/1748-9326/10/8/084007</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Storms following wildfires are known to impair drinking water supplies in the southwestern United States, yet our understanding of the role of precipitation in post-wildfire water quality is far from complete. We quantitatively assessed water-quality impacts of different hydrologic events in the Colorado Front Range and found that for a three-year period, substantial hydrologic and geochemical responses downstream of a burned area were primarily driven by convective storms with a 30 min rainfall intensity &gt;10 mm h −1 . These storms, which typically occur several times each year in July–September, are often small in area, short-lived, and highly variable in intensity and geographic distribution. Thus, a rain gage network with high temporal resolution and spatial density, together with high-resolution stream sampling, are required to adequately characterize post-wildfire responses. We measured total suspended sediment, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrate, and manganese concentrations that were 10–156 times higher downstream of a burned area compared to upstream during relatively common (50% annual exceedance probability) rainstorms, and water quality was sufficiently impaired to pose water-treatment concerns. Short-term water-quality impairment was driven primarily by increased surface runoff during higher intensity convective storms that caused erosion in the burned area and transport of sediment and chemical constituents to streams. Annual sediment yields downstream of the burned area were controlled by storm events and subsequent remobilization, whereas DOC yields were closely linked to annual runoff and thus were more dependent on interannual variation in spring runoff. Nitrate yields were highest in the third year post-wildfire. Results from this study quantitatively demonstrate that water quality can be altered for several years after wildfire. Because the southwestern US is prone to wildfires and high-intensity rain storms, the role of storms in post-wildfire water-quality impacts must be considered when assessing water-quality vulnerability.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/10/8/084007</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app

Changes in temperature and carbon dioxide during glacial cycles recorded in Antarctic ice cores are tightly coupled. However, this relationship does not hold for interglacials. While climate cooled towards the end of both the last (Eemian) and present (Holocene) interglacials, CO2 remained stable during the Eemian while rising in the Holocene. We identify and review twelve biogeochemical mechanisms of terrestrial (vegetation dynamics and CO2 fertilization, land use, wildfire, accumulation of peat, changes in permafrost carbon, subaerial volcanic outgassing) and marine origin (changes in sea surface temperature, carbonate compensation to deglaciation and terrestrial biosphere regrowth, shallow-water carbonate sedimentation, changes in the soft tissue pump, and methane hydrates), which potentially may have contributed to the CO2 dynamics during interglacials but which remain not well quantified. We use three Earth System Models (ESMs) of intermediate complexity to compare effects of selected mechanisms on the interglacial CO2 and δ13CO2 changes, focusing on those with substantial potential impacts: namely carbonate sedimentation in shallow waters, peat growth, and (in the case of the Holocene) human land use. A set of specified carbon cycle forcings could qualitatively explain atmospheric CO2 dynamics from 8 ka BP to the pre-industrial. However, when applied to Eemian boundary conditions from 126 to 115 ka BP, the same set of forcings led to disagreement with the observed direction of CO2 changes after 122 ka BP. This failure to simulate late-Eemian CO2 dynamics could be a result of the imposed forcings such as prescribed CaCO3 accumulation and/or an incorrect response of simulated terrestrial carbon to the surface cooling at the end of the interglacial. These experiments also reveal that key natural processes of interglacial CO2 dynamics – shallow water CaCO3 accumulation, peat and permafrost carbon dynamics - are not well represented in the current ESMs. Global-scale modeling of these long-term carbon cycle components started only in the last decade, and uncertainty in parameterization of these mechanisms is a main limitation in the successful modeling of interglacial CO2 dynamics.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379116300300</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tillery, Anne C</author><author>Haas, Jessica R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Potential postwildfire debris-flow hazards—A prewildfire evaluation for the Jemez Mountains, north-central New Mexico</title></titles><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2016-5101</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20165101</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Clark, J.S.</author><author>Iverson, L.</author><author>Woodall, CW</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Vose, James M.;

Here, we determined levoglucosan and phenolic compounds (PCs) at diverse Antarctic sites: on the plateau, a coastal station and during an oceanographic cruise. Levoglucosan and PCs reached the Antarctic plateau where they were observed in accumulation mode aerosols (with median levoglucosan concentrations of 6.4pgm−3 and 4.1pgm−3, and median PC concentrations of 15.0pgm−3 and 7.3pgm−3). Aged aerosols arrived at the coastal site through katabatic circulation with the majority of the levoglucosan mass distributed on larger particulates (24.8pgm−3), while PCs were present in fine particles (34.0pgm−3). The low levoglucosan/PC ratios in Antarctic aerosols suggest that biomass burning aerosols only had regional, rather than local, sources. General acid/aldehyde ratios were lower at the coastal site than on the plateau. Levoglucosan and PCs determined during the oceanographic cruise were 37.6pgm−3 and 58.5pgm−3 respectively. Unlike levoglucosan, which can only be produced by biomass burning, PCs have both biomass burning and other sources. Our comparisons of these two types of compounds across a range of Antarctic marine, coastal, and plateau sites demonstrate that local marine sources dominate Antarctic PC concentrations.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969715311475</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database

It is important that the source of data is commensurate with the spatial and temporal scale of the question addressed, but fire history databases are derived from different sources with different restrictions. In California, a frequently used fire history dataset is the State of California Fire and Resource Assessment Program (FRAP) fire history database, which circumscribes fire perimeters at a relatively fine scale. It includes large fires on both state and federal lands but only covers fires that were mapped or had other spatially explicit data.Adifferent database is the state and federal governments’ annual reports of all fires. They are more complete than the FRAP database but are only spatially explicit to the level of county (California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection – Cal Fire) or forest (United States Forest Service – USFS). We found substantial differences between the FRAP database and the annual summaries, with the largest and most consistent discrepancy being in fire frequency. The FRAP database missed the majority of fires and is thus a poor indicator of fire frequency or indicators of ignition sources. The FRAP database is also deficient in area burned, especially before 1950. Even in contemporary records, the huge number of smaller fires not included in theFRAPdatabase account for substantial cumulative differences in area burned. Wildfires in California account for nearly half of the western United States fire suppression budget. Therefore, the conclusions about data discrepancies and the implications for fire research are of broad importance.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70182203</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chambers, Jeanne C.</author><author>Beck, Jeffrey L.</author><author>Campbell, Steve</author><author>Carlson, John</author><author>Christiansen, Thomas J.</author><author>Clause, Karen J.</author><author>Dinkins, Jonathan B.</author><author>Doherty, Kevin E.</author><author>Griffin, Kathleen A.</author><author>Havlina, Douglas W.</author><author>Henke, Kenneth F.</author><author>Hennig, Jacob D.</author><author>Kurth, Laurie L.</author><author>Maestas, Jeremy D.</author><author>Manning, Mary</author><author>Mayer, Kenneth E.</author><author>Mealor, Brian A.</author><author>McCarthy, Clinton</author><author>Perea, Marco A.</author><author>Pyke, David A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using resilience and resistance concepts to manage threats to sagebrush ecosystems, Gunnison sage-grouse, and Greater sage-grouse in their eastern range: A strategic multi-scale approach</title></titles><pages>143-143</pages><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>RMRS-GTR-356</isbn><abstract>© 2016, USDA Forest Service. All rights reserved. This report provides a strategic approach developed by a Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies interagency working group for conservation of sagebrush ecosystems, Greater sage-grouse, and Gunnison sage-grouse. It uses information on (1) factors that influence sagebrush ecosystem resilience to disturbance and resistance to nonnative invasive annual grasses and (2) distribution and relative abundance of sage-grouse populations to address persistent ecosystem threats, such as invasive annual grasses and wildfire, and land use and development threats, such as oil and gas development and cropland conversion, to develop effective management strategies. A sage-grouse habitat matrix links relative resilience and resistance of sagebrush ecosystems with modeled sage-grouse breeding habitat probabilities to help decisionmakers assess risks and determine appropriate management strategies at both landscape and site scales. Areas for targeted management are assessed by overlaying matrix components with Greater sage-grouse Priority Areas for Conservation and Gunnison sage-grouse critical habitat and linkages, breeding bird concentration areas, and specific habitat threats. Decision tools are discussed for determining the suitability of target areas for management and the most appropriate management actions. A similar approach was developed for the Great Basin that was incorporated into the Federal land use plan amendments and served as the basis of a Bureau of Land Management Fire and Invasives Assessment Tool, which was used to prioritize sage-grouse habitat for targeted management activities.</abstract><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/pubs/53201</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pennington, Victoria E.</author><author>Schlaepfer, Daniel R.</author><author>Beck, Jeffrey L.</author><author>Bradford, John B.</author><author>Palmquist, Kyle A.</author><author>Lauenroth, William K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sagebrush, Greater Sage-Grouse, and the Occurrence and Importance of Forbs</title><secondary-title>Western North American Naturalist</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Western North American Naturalist</full-title></periodical><pages>298-312</pages><volume>76</volume><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3398/064.076.0307</electronic-resource-num><abstract>BioOne (www.bioone.org) is a nonprofit, online aggregation of core research in the biological, ecological, and environmental sciences.

ABSTRACT.—Big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.) ecosystems provide habitat for sagebrush-obligate wildlife species such as the Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). The understory of big sagebrush plant communities is composed of grasses and forbs that are important sources of cover and food for wildlife. The grass component is well described in the literature, but the composition, abundance, and habitat role of forbs in these communities is largely unknown. Our objective was to synthesize information about forbs and their importance to Greater Sage-Grouse diets and habitats, how rangeland management practices affect forbs, and how forbs respond to changes in temperature and precipitation. We also sought to identify research gaps and needs concerning forbs in big sagebrush plant communities. We searched for relevant literature including journal articles and state and federal agency reports. Our results indicated that in the spring and summer, Greater Sage-Grouse diets consist of forbs (particularly species in the Asteraceae family), arthropods, and lesser amounts of sagebrush. The diets transition to sagebrush in fall and winter. Forbs provide cover for Greater Sage-Grouse individuals at their lekking, nesting, and brood-rearing sites, and the species has a positive rela-tionship with arthropod presence. The effect of grazing on native forbs may be compounded by invasion of nonnative species and differs depending on grazing intensity. The effect of fire on forbs varies greatly and may depend on time elapsed since burning. In addition, chemical and mechanical treatments affect annual and perennial forbs differently. Temperature and precipitation influence forb phenology, biomass, and abundance differently among species. Our review identified several uncertainties and research needs about forbs in big sagebrush ecosystems. First, in many cases the literature about forbs is reported only at the genus or functional type level. Second, information about forb composi-tion and abundance near lekking sites is limited, despite the fact that lekking sites are an important center of Greater Sage-Grouse activity. Third, there is little published literature on the relationship between forbs and precipitation and between forbs and temperature, thereby limiting our ability to understand potential responses of forbs to climate change. While there is wide agreement among Greater Sage-Grouse biologists that forbs are an important habitat component, our knowledge about the distribution and environmental responses of forb species in big sagebrush plant communities is limited. Our work for the first time synthesizes the current knowledge regarding forbs in sagebrush ecosystems and their importance for Greater Sage-Grouse and identifies additional research needs for effective conser-vation and management. RESUMEN.—Los ecosistemas de artemisa (Artemisia tridentata Nutt) son el hábitat de especies silvestres como el urogallo de las artemisas (Centrocercus urophasianus). El sotobosque de las comunidades de plantas de artemisa grandes se compone de pastos y malezas que son importantes fuentes de cobertura y alimento para la fauna. El componente de pastos está bien descrito en la literatura, pero hay un vacío en el conocimiento de la composición, abundancia y el papel que juega el hábitat de especies herbáceas en estas comunidades. Nuestro objetivo fue sintetizar información sobre las plantas herbáceas y su importancia para las dietas y los hábitats de los urogallos, cómo las prácticas de manejo de los pastizales afectan a las plantas herbáceas y cómo éstas responden a los cambios de temperatura y precipitación. También intentamos identificar las deficiencias en las investigaciones y las necesidades de las plantas herbáceas en comunidades de plantas de artemisa grandes. Realizamos búsquedas generales en la literatura relevante, incluyendo artículos en revistas e informes gubernamentales y reportes de agencias federales. Nuestros resultados indican que, durante la primavera y el verano, la dieta de los urogallos consiste de hierbas, en particular de especies de la familia Asteraceae, artrópodos y, en menor medida, artemisas. Su dieta cambió a artemisas durante el otoño y el invierno. Las plantas herbáceas ofrecen cobertura a los urogallos en sus áreas de lek, anidación y lugares de cría, y tienen una relación positiva con la presencia de artrópodos. Los efectos del pastoreo en las plantas herbáceas nativas pueden agravarse con la invasión de especies no nativas, y difieren dependiendo de la intensidad del pastoreo. Los efectos del fuego en las plantas herbáceas son muy variables, y pueden depender del tiempo transcurrido desde la quema. Además, los tratamientos químicos y mecánicos afectan a las plantas herbáceas anuales y perennes de manera diferente. La temperatura y la precipitación influencian la fenología, la biomasa y la abundancia de las herbáceas de manera diferente entre especies. Nuestra revisión identificó varias incertidumbres y la necesidad de estudiar las plantas herbáceas en los ecosistemas de artemisa. En primer lugar, en muchos casos, la literatura informa sólo a nivel de género o funcional sobre las herbáceas. En segundo lugar, la información</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.bioone.org/doi/10.3398/064.076.0307</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pausas, Juli G.</author><author>Pratt, R.

Resprouting ability is often considered a simple qualitative trait and used in many ecological studies. Our aim is to show some of the complexities of resprouting while highlighting cautions that need be taken in using resprouting ability to predict vegetation responses across disturbance types and biomes. There are marked differences in resprouting depending on the disturbance type, and fire is often the most severe disturbance because it includes both defoliation and lethal temperatures. In the Mediterranean biome, there are differences in functional strategies to cope with water deficit between resprouters (dehydration avoiders) and nonresprouters (dehydration tolerators); however, there is little research to unambiguously extrapolate these results to other biomes. Furthermore, predictions of vegetation responses to changes in disturbance regimes require consideration not only of resprouting, but also other relevant traits (e.g. seeding, bark thickness) and the different correlations among traits observed in different biomes; models lacking these details would behave poorly at the global scale. Overall, the lessons learned from a given disturbance regime and biome (e.g. crown-fire Mediterranean ecosystems) can guide research in other ecosystems but should not be extrapolated at the global scale.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70159579</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Peterson, By Birgit E</author><author>Nelson, Kurtis J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Enhanced Canopy Fuel Mapping by Integrating Lidar Data</title></titles><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2015-3086</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/fs20153086</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Smith, David Solance</author><author>Fettig, Stephen M.</author><author>Bowker, Matthew A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Elevated Rocky Mountain elk numbers prevent positive effects of fire on quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) recruitment</title><secondary-title>Forest Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forest Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>46-54</pages><volume>362</volume><keywords><keyword>Regeneration</keyword><keyword>Herbivory</keyword><keyword>Introduced species</keyword><keyword>Mega-fire</keyword><keyword>Ungulate</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0378-1127</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.foreco.2015.11.020</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) is the most widespread tree species in North America and has supported a unique ecosystem for tens of thousands of years, yet is currently threatened by dramatic loss and possible local extinctions. While multiple factors such as climate change and fire suppression are thought to contribute to aspen's decline, increased browsing by elk (Cervus elaphus), which have experienced dramatic population increases in the last ~80. years, may severely inhibit aspen growth and regeneration. Fires are known to favor aspen recovery, but in the last several decades the spatial scale and intensity of wildfires has greatly increased, with poorly understood ramifications for aspen growth. Here, focusing on the 2000 Cerro Grande fire in central New Mexico - one of the earliest fires described as a "mega-fire" - we use three methods to examine the impact of elk browsing on aspen regeneration after a mega-fire. First, we use an exclosure experiment to show that aspen growing in the absence of elk were 3× taller than trees growing in the presence of elk. Further, aspen that were both protected from elk and experienced burning were 8.5× taller than unburned trees growing in the presence of elk, suggesting that the combination of release from herbivores and stimulation from fire creates the largest aspen growth rates. Second, using surveys at the landscape level, we found a correlation between elk browsing intensity and aspen height, such that where elk browsing was highest, aspen were shortest. This relationship between elk browsing intensity and aspen height was stronger in burned (r = -0.53) compared to unburned (r = -0.24) areas. Third, in conjunction with the landscape-level surveys, we identified possible natural refugia, microsites containing downed logs, shrubs etc. that may inhibit elk browsing by physically blocking aspen from elk or by impeding elk's ability to move through the forest patch. We did not find any consistent patterns between refuge elements and aspen size or canopy cover suggesting that natural refugia are not aiding in aspen recruitment and that all young aspen were susceptible to browsing. In much of their normal range, aspen are not growing to large size classes, which threatens the future of this iconic species and calls into question the ability of ecosystems to recover from mega-fires. Our results highlight the importance of considering multiple interacting factors (i.e. fire and increased elk browsing) when considering aspen management and regeneration.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70171090</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Abella, Scott R.</author><author>Berry, Kristin H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Enhancing and Restoring Habitat for the Desert Tortoise</title><secondary-title>Journal of Fish and Wildlife Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Fish and Wildlife Management</full-title></periodical><pages>255-279</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3996/052015-JFWM-046</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Habitat has changed unfavorably during the past 150 y for the desert tortoise Gopherus agassizii, a federally threatened species with declining populations in the Mojave Desert and western Sonoran Desert. To support recovery efforts, we synthesized published information on relationships of desert tortoises with three habitat features (cover sites, forage, and soil) and candidate management practices for improving these features for tortoises. In addition to their role in soil health and facilitating recruitment of annual forage plants, shrubs are used by desert tortoises for cover and as sites for burrows. Outplanting greenhouse-grown seedlings, protected from herbivory, has successfully restored (&gt;50% survival) a variety of shrubs on disturbed desert soils. Additionally, salvaging and reapplying topsoil using effective techniques is among the more ecologically beneficial ways to initiate plant recovery after severe disturbance. Through differences in biochemical composition and digestibility, some plant species provide better-quality forage than others. Desert tortoises selectively forage on particular annual and herbaceous perennial species (e.g., legumes), and forage selection shifts during the year as different plants grow or mature. Nonnative grasses provide low-quality forage and contribute fuel to spreading wildfires, which damage or kill shrubs that tortoises use for cover. Maintaining a diverse “menu” of native annual forbs and decreasing nonnative grasses are priorities for restoring most desert tortoise habitats. Reducing herbivory by nonnative animals, carefully timing herbicide applications, and strategically augmenting annual forage plants via seeding show promise for improving tortoise forage quality. Roads, another disturbance, negatively affect habitat in numerous ways (e.g., compacting soil, altering hydrology). Techniques such as recontouring road berms to reestablish drainage patterns, vertical mulching (“planting” dead plant material), and creating barriers to prevent trespasses can assist natural recovery on decommissioned backcountry roads. Most habitat enhancement efforts to date have focused on only one factor at a time (e.g., providing fencing) and have not included proactive restoration activities (e.g., planting native species on disturbed soils). A research and management priority in recovering desert tortoise habitats is implementing an integrated set of restorative habitat enhancements (e.g., reducing nonnative plants, improving forage quality, augmenting native perennial plants, and ameliorating altered hydrology) and monitoring short- and long-term indicators of habitat condition and the responses of desert tortoises to habitat restoration.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.fwspubs.org/doi/10.3996/052015-JFWM-046</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Mantgem, Phillip J.</author><author>Lalemand, Laura B.</author><author>Keifer, Mary Beth</author><author>Kane, Jeffrey M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Duration of fuels reduction following prescribed fire in coniferous forests of U.S. national parks in California and the Colorado Plateau</title><secondary-title>Forest Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forest Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>265-272</pages><volume>379</volume><keywords><keyword>Fire effects</keyword><keyword>Forest management</keyword><keyword>Fire modeling</keyword><keyword>Fuels treatments</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.foreco.2016.07.028</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Prescribed fire is a widely used forest management tool, yet the long-term effectiveness of prescribed fire in reducing fuels and fire hazards in many vegetation types is not well documented. We assessed the magnitude and duration of reductions in surface fuels and modeled fire hazards in coniferous forests across nine U.S. national parks in California and the Colorado Plateau. We used observations from a prescribed fire effects monitoring program that feature standard forest and surface fuels inventories conducted pre-fire, immediately following an initial (first-entry) prescribed fire and at varying intervals up to &gt;20 years post-fire. A subset of these plots was subjected to prescribed fire again (second-entry) with continued monitoring. Prescribed fire effects were highly variable among plots, but we found on average first-entry fires resulted in a significant post-fire reduction in surface fuels, with litter and duff fuels not returning to pre-fire levels over the length of our observations. Fine and coarse woody fuels often took a decade or longer to return to pre-fire levels. For second-entry fires we found continued fuels reductions, without strong evidence of fuel loads returning to levels observed immediately prior to second-entry fire. Following both first- and second-entry fire there were increases in estimated canopy base heights, along with reductions in estimated canopy bulk density and modeled flame lengths. We did not find evidence of return to pre-fire conditions during our observation intervals for these measures of fire hazard. Our results show that prescribed fire can be a valuable tool to reduce fire hazards and, depending on forest conditions and the measurement used, reductions in fire hazard can last for decades. Second-entry prescribed fire appeared to reinforce the reduction in fuels and fire hazard from first-entry fires.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70176196</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Edwards, Mary</author><author>Grosse, Guido</author><author>Jones, Benjamin M.</author><author>McDowell, Patricia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The evolution of a thermokarst-lake landscape: Late Quaternary permafrost degradation and stabilization in interior Alaska</title><secondary-title>Sedimentary Geology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Sedimentary Geology</full-title></periodical><pages>3-14</pages><volume>340</volume><keywords><keyword>Holocene</keyword><keyword>Alaska</keyword><keyword>LiDAR</keyword><keyword>Non-linear processes</keyword><keyword>Permafrost degradation</keyword><keyword>Thermokarst lakes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.sedgeo.2016.01.018</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Thermokarst processes characterize a variety of ice-rich permafrost terrains and often lead to lake formation. The long-term evolution of thermokarst landscapes and the stability and longevity of lakes depend upon climate, vegetation and ground conditions, including the volume of excess ground ice and its distribution. The current lake status of thermokarst-lake landscapes and their future trajectories under climate warming are better understood in the light of their long-term development. We studied the lake-rich southern marginal upland of the Yukon Flats (northern interior Alaska) using dated lake-sediment cores, observations of river-cut exposures, and remotely-sensed data. The region features thick (up to 40 m) Quaternary deposits (mainly loess) that contain massive ground ice. Two of three studied lakes formed ~ 11,000–12,000 cal yr BP through inferred thermokarst processes, and fire may have played a role in initiating thermokarst development. From ~ 9000 cal yr BP, all lakes exhibited steady sedimentation, and pollen stratigraphies are consistent with regional patterns. The current lake expansion rates are low (0 to &lt; 7 cm yr− 1shoreline retreat) compared with other regions (~ 30 cm yr− 1or more). This thermokarst lake-rich region does not show evidence of extensive landscape lowering by lake drainage, nor of multiple lake generations within a basin. However, LiDAR images reveal linear “corrugations” (&gt; 5 m amplitude), deep thermo-erosional gullies, and features resembling lake drainage channels, suggesting that highly dynamic surface processes have previously shaped the landscape. Evidently, widespread early Holocene permafrost degradation and thermokarst lake initiation were followed by lake longevity and landscape stabilization, the latter possibly related to establishment of dense forest cover. Partial or complete drainage of three lakes in 2013 reveals that there is some contemporary landscape dynamism. Holocene landscape evolution in the study area differs from that described from other thermokarst-affected regions; regional responses to future environmental change may be equally individualistic.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70168775</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ebel, Brian A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Soil depth and soil-hydraulic properties of the Sugarloaf experimental catchment; 2010 Fourmile Canyon Fire area, Colorado</title></titles><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5066/F7F769NK</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70182183</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mast, M.

A combination of fixed-interval sampling and continuous water-quality monitors was used to examine the timing and magnitude of water-quality changes caused by the wildfire. Prefire water quality was well characterized because the site has been monitored at least monthly since the early 2000s. Major ions and nitrate showed the largest changes in concentrations; major ion increases were greatest in the first postfire snowmelt period, but nitrate increases were greatest in the second snowmelt period. The delay in nitrate release until the second snowmelt season likely reflected a combination of factors including fire timing, hydrologic regime, and rates of nitrogen transformations. Despite the small size of the fire, annual yields of dissolved constituents from the watershed increased 20–52% in the first 2 years following the fire. Turbidity data from the continuous sensor indicated high-intensity summer rain storms had a much greater effect on sediment transport compared to snowmelt. High-frequency sensor data also revealed that weekly sampling missed the concentration peak during snowmelt and short-duration spikes during rain events, underscoring the challenge of characterizing postfire water-quality response with fixed-interval sampling.

The purpose of this study was two-fold: 1) to determine the effect of the 2009 Station Fire in the Angeles National Forest northeast of Los Angeles, CA on trace element concentrations in streams, and 2) compare trace elements in post-fire stormflow water quality to criteria for aquatic life to determine if trace elements reached concentrations that can harm aquatic life. Pre-storm and stormflow water-quality samples were collected in streams located inside and outside of the burn area of the Station Fire. Ash and burned soil samples were collected from several locations within the perimeter of the Station Fire. Filtered concentrations of Fe, Mn, and Hg and total concentrations of most trace elements in storm samples were elevated as a result of the Station Fire. In contrast, filtered concentrations of Cu, Pb, Ni, and Se and total concentrations of Cu were elevated primarily due to storms and not the Station Fire. Total concentrations of Se and Zn were elevated as a result of both storms and the Station Fire. Suspended sediment in stormflows following the Station Fire was an important transport mechanism for trace elements. Cu, Pb, and Zn primarily originate from ash in the suspended sediment. Fe primarily originates from burned soil in the suspended sediment. As, Mn, and Ni originate from both ash and burned soil. Filtered concentrations of trace elements in stormwater samples affected by the Station Fire did not reach levels that were greater than criteria established for aquatic life.

However, despite a large and increasing allocation of resources and personnel to achieve these goals, fire management objectives at regional to global scales are not being met. Current fire management techniques are clearly inadequate for the challenges faced by fire managers, and technological innovations are needed. Advances in unmanned aerial systems (UAS) technology provide opportunities for innovation in fire management and science. In many countries, fire management organizations are beginning to explore the potential of UAS for monitoring fires. We have taken the next step and developed a prototype that can precisely ignite fires as part of wildfire suppression tactics or prescribed fires (fire intentionally ignited within predetermined conditions to reduce hazardous fuels, improve habitat, or mitigate for large wildfires). We discuss the potential for these technolo-gies to benefit fire management activities, while acknowledging the sizeable sociopolitical barriers that prevent their immediate broad application. Front Ecol Environ 2016; 14(6): 333–339, doi:10.1002/fee.1299 S ince the onset of the Industrial Revolution, calls for innovation in fire management are the result of a continued inability to coexist with fire (Bowman et al. 2009). For tens of thousands of years, in many regions of the world, humans deliberately ignited fires to manipu-late nature for their benefit, thereby increasing the occurrence of fires and their impacts as an ecological and evolutionary process (Bowman et al. 2011; McWethy et al. 2013). The opposite is true today. Fire management professionals are pressured to meet the often conflicting need to control wildfires to protect lives and property (Figure 1a), while also igniting prescribed fires (any fire intentionally ignited within predetermined conditions to reduce hazardous fuels, improve habitat, or mitigate for large wildfires; Figure 1b). Yet, despite good intentions and billions of dollars invested, large wildfires are becom-ing more common (Flannigan et al. 2009), and the costs of fighting wildfires are escalating (Calkin et al. 2015). With regard to wildfire suppression, US federal agencies spent US$15 billion from 2006–2015, which was more than the total amount of money expended on similar efforts in the previous 20 years (NIFC nd). Risk aversion is increasing among agencies that have historically pro-vided proactive fire management (DellaSala et al. 2004; Hawbaker et al. 2013), and some federal agencies in the US have now established internal policies that prevent their personnel from direct involvement with prescribed fires conducted on private lands (Twidwell et al. 2015). Such aversions have produced more limited fire prescrip-tions, with the pathological effect of creating ever-tightening windows of meteorological and environmental conditions under which deliberate ignitions are allowed (Twidwell et al. 2016). As a result, prescribed fires are rarely conducted in conditions that mimic the dynamics of historical fire regimes (Twidwell et al. 2016), resulting in declines of many floral and faunal specialists (eg Smucker et al. 2005; Hutto 2008; van Wilgen 2013) and failure to prevent or reverse undesirable state transitions (eg from grassland to shrubland or woodland; Bond et al. 2005; Twidwell et al. 2013a). Advances in unmanned aerial systems (UAS) technol-ogy provide opportunities for innovation in fire manage-ment and science. Wildland firefighting and prescribed fire operations have long relied on manned aerial vehicles or ground crews for monitoring, ignition, and suppression, which carry inherent risks to human life.

The greater sage-grouse is a sagebrush-obligate species whose populations generally track declines in sagebrush, and is highly influential in shaping state and national land-use policy. Using three decades of sage-grouse population count, wildfire, and climate data within a modeling framework that allowed for variable postfire recovery of sagebrush, we provide quantitative evidence that links long-term declines of sage-grouse to chronic effects of wildfire. Projected declines may be slowed or halted by targeting fire suppression in remaining areas of intact sagebrush with high densities of breeding sage-grouse. Iconic sagebrush ecosystems of the American West are threatened by larger and more frequent wildfires that can kill sagebrush and facilitate invasion by annual grasses, creating a cycle that alters sagebrush ecosystem recovery post disturbance. Thwarting this accelerated grass-fire cycle is at the forefront of current national conservation efforts, yet its impacts on wildlife populations inhabiting these ecosystems have not been quantified rigorously. Within a Bayesian framework, we modeled 30 y of wildfire and climatic effects on population rates of change of a sagebrush-obligate species, the greater sage-grouse, across the Great Basin of western North America. Importantly, our modeling also accounted for variation in sagebrush recovery time post fire as determined by underlying soil properties that influence ecosystem resilience to disturbance and resistance to invasion. Our results demonstrate that the cumulative loss of sagebrush to direct and indirect effects of wildfire has contributed strongly to declining sage-grouse populations over the past 30 y at large spatial scales. Moreover, long-lasting effects from wildfire nullified pulses of sage-grouse population growth that typically follow years of higher precipitation. If wildfire trends continue unabated, model projections indicate sage-grouse populations will be reduced to 43% of their current numbers over the next three decades. Our results provide a timely example of how altered fire regimes are disrupting recovery of sagebrush ecosystems and leading to substantial declines of a widespread indicator species. Accordingly, we present scenario-based stochastic projections to inform conservation actions that may help offset the adverse effects of wildfire on sage-grouse and other wildlife populations.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1606898113</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Halsey, R.W.</author><author>Keeley, J.E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Conservation Issues: California Chaparral</title><secondary-title>Reference Module in Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Reference Module in Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences</full-title></periodical><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><isbn>978-0-12-409548-9</isbn><abstract>California chaparral, a sclerophyllous shrub-dominated plant community shaped by a Mediterranean-type climate and infrequent, high-intensity fire, is one of the most biodiverse and threatened habitats on Earth.

In fact, fire risk reduction and biodiversity conservation are often viewed as competing objectives. Here we explored the role of management through private land conservation and asked whether we could identify private land acquisition strategies that fulfill the mutual objectives of biodiversity conservation and fire risk reduction, or whether the maximization of one objective comes at a detriment to the other. Using a fixed budget and number of homes slated for development, we simulated 20 years of housing growth under alternative conservation selection strategies, and then projected the mean risk of fires destroying structures and the area and configuration of important habitat types in San Diego County, California, USA. We found clear differences in both fire risk projections and biodiversity impacts based on the way conservation lands are prioritized for selection, but these differences were split between two distinct groupings. If no conservation lands were purchased, or if purchases were prioritized based on cost or likelihood of development, both the projected fire risk and biodiversity impacts were much higher than if conservation lands were purchased in areas with high fire hazard or high species richness. Thus, conserving land focused on either of the two objectives resulted in nearly equivalent mutual benefits for both. These benefits not only resulted from preventing development in sensitive areas, but they were also due to the different housing patterns and arrangements that occurred as development was displaced from those areas. Although biodiversity conflicts may still arise using other fire management strategies, this study shows that mutual objectives can be attained through land-use planning in this region. These results likely generalize to any place where high species richness overlaps with hazardous wildland vegetation.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70174856</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Williams, Perry J.</author><author>Hooten, Mevin B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Combining statistical inference and decisions in ecology</title><secondary-title>Ecological Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>1930-1942</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Bayes rule</keyword><keyword>Bayesian risk</keyword><keyword>Firequentist risk</keyword><keyword>Loss function</keyword><keyword>Optimal posterior estimator</keyword><keyword>Statistical decision theory</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1939-5582</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1890/15-1593.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Statistical decision theory (SDT) is a sub-field of decision theory that formally incorporates statistical investigation into a decision-theoretic framework to account for uncertainties in a decision problem. SDT provides a unifying analysis of three types of information: statistical results from a data set, knowledge of the consequences of potential choices (i.e., loss), and prior beliefs about a system. SDT links the theoretical development of a large body of statistical methods including point estimation, hypothesis testing, and confidence interval estimation. The theory and application of SDT have mainly been developed and published in the fields of mathematics, statistics, operations research, and other decision sciences, but have had limited exposure in ecology. Thus, we provide an introduction to SDT for ecologists and describe its utility for linking the conventionally separate tasks of statistical investigation and decision making in a single framework. We describe the basic framework of both Bayesian and frequentist SDT, its traditional use in statistics, and discuss its application to decision problems that occur in ecology. We demonstrate SDT with two types of decisions: Bayesian point estimation, and an applied management problem of selecting a prescribed fire rotation for managing a grassland bird species. Central to SDT, and decision theory in general, are loss functions. Thus, we also provide basic guidance and references for constructing loss functions for an SDT problem.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70173660</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stoof, Cathelijne R.</author><author>Gevaert, Anouk I.</author><author>Baver, Christine</author><author>Hassanpour, Bahareh</author><author>Morales, Verónica L.</author><author>Zhang, Wei</author><author>Martin, Deborah</author><author>Giri, Shree K.</author><author>Steenhuis, Tammo S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Can pore-clogging by ash explain post-fire runoff?</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</full-title></periodical><pages>294-305</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>hydraulic conductivity</keyword><keyword>infiltration</keyword><keyword>wildland fire ash</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1071/WF15037</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Ash plays an important role in controlling runoff and erosion processes after wildfire and has frequently been hypothesised to clog soil pores and reduce infiltration. Yet evidence for clogging is incomplete, as research has focussed on identifying the presence of ash in soil; the actual flow processes remain unknown. We conducted laboratory infiltration experiments coupled with microscope observations in pure sands, saturated hydraulic conductivity analysis, and interaction energy calculations, to test whether ash can clog pores (i.e. block pores such that infiltration is hampered and ponding occurs). Although results confirmed previous observations of ash washing into pores, clogging was not observed in the pure sands tested, nor were conditions found for which this does occur. Clogging by means of strong attachment of ash to sand was deemed unlikely given the negative surface charge of the two materials. Ponding due to washing in of ash was also considered improbable given the high saturated conductivity of pure ash and ash-sand mixtures. This first mechanistic step towards analysing ash transport and attachment processes in field soils therefore suggests that pore clogging by ash is unlikely to occur in sands. Discussion is provided on other mechanisms by which ash can affect post-fire hydrology.

The majority of existing debris flow modeling has focused on landslide-triggered debris flows. In this study we explore the potential for using process-based rainfall-runoff models to simulate the timing of water flow and runoff-generated debris flows in recently burned areas. Two different spatially distributed hydrologic models with differing levels of complexity were used: the full shallow water equations and the kinematic wave approximation. Model parameter values were calibrated in two different watersheds, spanning two orders of magnitude in drainage area. These watersheds were affected by the 2009 Station Fire in the San Gabriel Mountains, CA, USA. Input data for the numerical models were constrained by time series of soil moisture, flow stage, and rainfall collected at field sites, as well as high-resolution lidar-derived digital elevation models. The calibrated parameters were used to model a third watershed in the burn area, and the results show a good match with observed timing of flow peaks. The calibrated roughness parameter (Manning's n) was generally higher when using the kinematic wave approximation relative to the shallow water equations, and decreased with increasing spatial scale. The calibrated effective watershed hydraulic conductivity was low for both models, even for storms occurring several months after the fire, suggesting that wildfire-induced changes to soil-water infiltration were retained throughout that time. Overall, the two model simulations were quite similar suggesting that a kinematic wave model, which is simpler and more computationally efficient, is a suitable approach for predicting flood and debris flow timing in steep, burned watersheds.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70168517</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Picotte, Joshua J.</author><author>Peterson, Birgit</author><author>Meier, Gretchen</author><author>Howard, Stephen M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>1984-2010 trends in fire burn severity and area for the conterminous US</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</full-title></periodical><pages>413-420</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Landsat</keyword><keyword>wildfire</keyword><keyword>differenced Normalized Burn Ratio</keyword><keyword>LANDFIRE Environmental Site Potential</keyword><keyword>MTBS</keyword><keyword>Relativized differenced Normalized Burn Ratio</keyword><keyword>sigmoid distribution</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1049-8001</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1071/WF15039</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Burn severity products created by the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) project were used to analyse historical trends in burn severity.

Yearly mean burn severity values (weighted by area), maximum burn severity metric values, mean area of burn, maximum burn area and total burn area were evaluated within 27 US National Vegetation Classification macrogroups.

Burned area and severity varied by vegetation classification, but most vegetation groups showed no detectable change during the 1984–2010 period. Of the 27 analysed vegetation groups, trend analysis revealed burned area increased in eight, and burn severity has increased in seven.

In many fire-prone ecosystems species cue their germination to immediate postfire conditions. Here we address how species have evolved one very specific mechanism, which is using the signal of combustion products from biomass. This is often termed 'smoke' stimulated germination although it was first discovered in studies of charred wood effects on germination of species strictly tied to postfire conditions (pyroendemics). Smoke stimulated germination has been reported from a huge diversity of plant species. The fact that the organic compound karrikin (a product of the degradation of cellulose) is a powerful germination cue in many species has led to the assumption that this compound is the only chemical responsible for smoke-stimulated germination. Here we show that smoke-stimulated germination is a complex trait with different compounds involved. We propose that convergent evolution is a more parsimonious model for smoke stimulated germination, suggesting that this trait evolved multiple times in response to a variety of organic and inorganic chemical triggers in smoke. The convergent model is congruent with the evolution of many other fire-related traits.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70176629</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author><author>Thomas Parker, V.</author><author>Vasey, Michael C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Resprouting and seeding hypotheses: a test of the gap-dependent model using resprouting and obligate seeding subspecies of Arctostaphylos</title><secondary-title>Plant Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Plant Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>743-750</pages><volume>217</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Disturbance</keyword><keyword>Reproduction</keyword><keyword>Fire</keyword><keyword>Regeneration</keyword><keyword>Resprouters</keyword><keyword>Seeders</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1385-0237</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11258-015-0551-z</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Ecological factors favoring either postfire resprouting or postfire obligate seeding in plants have received considerable attention recently.

We examined the effects of cutting and burning treatments on the vegetative response (cover, stem density) and root resources of Oriental bittersweet (Celastrus orbiculatus), a liana invasive to North America that was introduced from East Asia. Treatments were control, spring cut, spring burn, spring cut &amp; burn, summer cut, fall cut, fall burn, fall cut &amp; burn, and fall herbicide. Cover was reduced the greatest by herbicide and summer cutting treatments, but increased more in the second year on moraine soils than on sandy soils. Burning and cutting &amp; burning combined resulted in a resprout density four times greater than stem density prior to treatment for stems &lt;2.5 mm diameter than cutting alone. For stems, across all diameter classes, there was a more than 100% increase in stem density with burning and almost a 300% increase in stem density with cutting &amp; burning in the spring. Density of resprouts and root-suckers, and survival increased with increasing stem size. While cutting of C. orbiculatus during the growing season (summer) reduced total nonstructural carbohydrates by 50% below early growing season levels and 75% below dormant season levels, burning did not significantly reduce total nonstructural carbohydrates. Thus, Oriental bittersweet is quite responsive to burning as a disturbance and resprouting and root-suckering creates additional opportunities for growth and attainment of the forest canopy. The positive response of Oriental bittersweet to burning has important implications for management of invasive lianas in fire-dependent forest landscapes.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70176546</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Krawchuk, Meg A.</author><author>Haire, Sandra L.</author><author>Coop, Jonathan</author><author>Parisien, Marc Andre</author><author>Whitman, Ellen</author><author>Chong, Geneva</author><author>Miller, Carol</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Topographic and fire weather controls of fire refugia in forested ecosystems of northwestern North America</title><secondary-title>Ecosphere</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecosphere</full-title></periodical><pages>1-18</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Burn severity</keyword><keyword>Topography</keyword><keyword>Burn mosaic</keyword><keyword>Fire refugia</keyword><keyword>Fire weather</keyword><keyword>Island</keyword><keyword>Predictability</keyword><keyword>Remnant</keyword><keyword>Topo-refugia</keyword><keyword>Unburned</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/ecs2.1632</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fire refugia, sometimes referred to as fire islands, shadows, skips, residuals, or fire remnants, are an important element of the burn mosaic, but we lack a quantitative framework that links observations of fire refugia from different environmental contexts. Here, we develop and test a conceptual model for how predictability of fire refugia varies according to topographic complexity and fire weather conditions. Refugia were quantified as areas unburned or burned at comparatively low severity based on remotely sensed burn severity data. We assessed the relationship between refugia and a suite of terrain-related explanatory metrics by fitting a collection of boosted regression tree models. The models were developed for seven study fires that burned in conifer-dominated forested landscapes of the Western Cordillera of Canada between 2001 and 2014. We fit nine models, each for distinct levels of fire weather and terrain ruggedness. Our framework revealed that the predictability and abundance of fire refugia varied among these environmental settings. We observed highest predictability under moderate fire weather conditions and moderate terrain ruggedness (ROC-AUC = 0.77), and lowest predictability in flatter landscapes and under high fire weather conditions (ROC-AUC = 0.63–0.68). Catchment slope, local aspect, relative position, topographic wetness, topographic convergence, and local slope all contributed to discriminating where refugia occur but the relative importance of these topographic controls differed among environments. Our framework allows us to characterize the predictability of contemporary fire refugia across multiple environmental settings and provides important insights for ecosystem resilience, wildfire management, conservation planning, and climate change adaptation.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70184183</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tagestad, Jerry</author><author>Brooks, Matthew</author><author>Cullinan, Valerie</author><author>Downs, Janelle</author><author>McKinley, Randy</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Precipitation regime classification for the Mojave Desert: Implications for fire occurrence</title><secondary-title>Journal of Arid Environments</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Arid Environments</full-title></periodical><pages>388-397</pages><volume>124</volume><keywords><keyword>Vegetation</keyword><keyword>Climate</keyword><keyword>Drought</keyword><keyword>Burn</keyword><keyword>Lightning</keyword><keyword>Seasonality</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jaridenv.2015.09.002</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Long periods of drought or above-average precipitation affect Mojave Desert vegetation condition, biomass and susceptibility to fire. Changes in the seasonality of precipitation alter the likelihood of lightning, a key ignition source for fires. The objectives of this study were to characterize the relationship between recent, historic, and future precipitation patterns and fire. Classifying monthly precipitation data from 1971 to 2010 reveals four precipitation regimes: low winter/low summer, moderate winter/moderate summer, high winter/low summer and high winter/high summer. Two regimes with summer monsoonal precipitation covered only 40% of the Mojave Desert ecoregion but contain 88% of the area burned and 95% of the repeat burn area. Classifying historic precipitation for early-century (wet) and mid-century (drought) periods reveals distinct shifts in regime boundaries. Early-century results are similar to current, while the mid-century results show a sizeable reduction in area of regimes with a strong monsoonal component. Such a shift would suggest that fires during the mid-century period would be minimal and anecdotal records confirm this. Predicted precipitation patterns from downscaled global climate models indicate numerous epochs of high winter precipitation, inferring higher fire potential for many multi-decade periods during the next century.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70176942</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nelson, By Kurtis J</author><author>Long, Donald G</author><author>Connot, Joel A</author><author>Jewell, Sally</author><author>Kimball, Suzette M</author><author>Survey, U S Geological</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>LANDFIRE 2010 — Updates to the National Dataset to Support Improved Fire and Natural Resource Management</title></titles><pages>48-48</pages><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2016-1010</isbn><abstract>The Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools (LANDFIRE) 2010 data release provides updated and enhanced vegetation, fuel, and fire regime layers consistently across the United States.

Enhancements to the data products included refinement of urban areas by incorporating the National Land Cover Database 2006 land cover product, refinement of agricultural lands by integrating the National Agriculture Statistics Service 2011 cropland data layer, and improved wetlands delineations using the National Land Cover Database 2006 land cover and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory data. Disturbance layers were generated for years 2008 through 2010 using remotely sensed imagery, polygons representing disturbance events submitted by local organizations, and fire mapping program data such as the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity perimeters produced by the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Forest Service. Existing vegetation data were updated to account for transitions in disturbed areas and to account for vegetation growth and succession in undisturbed areas. Surface and canopy fuel data were computed from the updated vegetation type, cover, and height and occasionally from potential vegetation. Historical fire frequency and succession classes were also updated. Revised topographic layers were created based on updated elevation data from the National Elevation Dataset. The LANDFIRE program also released a new Web site offering updated content, enhanced usability, and more efficient navigation.</abstract><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20161010</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brooks, Matthew L</author><author>Matchett, John R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fire patterns among ecological zones in the California desert, 1984–2013</title></titles><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5066/F75B00MP</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70179096</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lewis, Tyler L.</author><author>Schmutz, Joel A.</author><author>Amundson, Courtney L.</author><author>Lindberg, Mark S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Waterfowl populations are resilient to immediate and lagged impacts of wildfires in the boreal forest</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>1746-1754</pages><volume>53</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>climate change</keyword><keyword>disturbance</keyword><keyword>fire management</keyword><keyword>wildfire</keyword><keyword>resilience</keyword><keyword>boreal forest</keyword><keyword>dabblers</keyword><keyword>divers</keyword><keyword>waterfowl</keyword><keyword>Waterfowl Breeding Population and Habitat Survey</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/1365-2664.12705</electronic-resource-num><abstract>? 2016 British Ecological Society.Wildfires are the principal disturbance in the boreal forest, and their size and frequency are increasing as the climate warms. Impacts of fires on boreal wildlife are largely unknown, especially for the tens of millions of waterfowl that breed in the region. This knowledge gap creates significant barriers to the integrative management of fires and waterfowl, leading to fire policies that largely disregard waterfowl. Waterfowl populations across the western boreal forest of North America have been monitored annually since 1955 by the Waterfowl Breeding Population and Habitat Survey (BPOP), widely considered the most extensive wildlife survey in the world. Using these data, we examined impacts of forest fires on abundance of two waterfowl guilds - dabblers and divers. We modelled waterfowl abundance in relation to fire extent (i.e. amount of survey transect burned) and time since fire, examining both immediate and lagged fire impacts. From 1955 to 2014, &gt;1100 fires in the western boreal forest intersected BPOP survey transects, and many transects burned multiple times. Nonetheless, fires had no detectable impact on waterfowl abundance; annual transect counts of dabbler and diver pairs remained stable from the pre- to post-fire period. The absence of fire impacts on waterfowl abundance extended from the years immediately following the fire to those more than a decade afterwards. Likewise, the amount of transect burned did not influence waterfowl abundance, with similar pair counts from the pre- to post-fire period for small (1-20% burned), medium (21-60%) and large (&gt;60%) burns. Policy implications. Waterfowl populations appear largely resilient to forest fires, providing initial evidence that current policies of limited fire suppression, which predominate throughout much of the boreal forest, have not been detrimental to waterfowl populations. Likewise, fire-related management actions, such as prescribed burning or targeted suppression, seem to have limited impacts on waterfowl abundance and productivity. For waterfowl managers, our results suggest that adaptive models of waterfowl harvest, which annually guide hunting quotas, do not need to emphasize fires when integrating climate change effects.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70174177</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Littell, Jeremy S.</author><author>Peterson, David L.</author><author>Riley, Karin L.</author><author>Liu, Yongquiang</author><author>Luce, Charles H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A review of the relationships between drought and forest fire in the United States</title><secondary-title>Global change biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global change biology</full-title></periodical><pages>2353-2369</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>climate change</keyword><keyword>fire</keyword><keyword>drought</keyword><keyword>climate variability</keyword><keyword>ecological drought</keyword><keyword>water balance</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1365-2486</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/gcb.13275</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The historical and presettlement relationships between drought and wildfire are well documented in North America, with forest fire occurrence and area clearly increasing in response to drought. There is also evidence that drought interacts with other controls (forest productivity, topography, fire weather, management activities) to affect fire intensity, severity, extent, and frequency. Fire regime characteristics arise across many individual fires at a variety of spatial and temporal scales, so both weather and climate – including short- and long-term droughts – are important and influence several, but not all, aspects of fire regimes. We review relationships between drought and fire regimes in United States forests, fire-related drought metrics and expected changes in fire risk, and implications for fire management under climate change. Collectively, this points to a conceptual model of fire on real landscapes: fire regimes, and how they change through time, are products of fuels and how other factors affect their availability (abundance, arrangement, continuity) and flammability (moisture, chemical composition). Climate, management, and land use all affect availability, flammability, and probability of ignition differently in different parts of North America. From a fire ecology perspective, the concept of drought varies with scale, application, scientific or management objective, and ecosystem.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70171055</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gaglioti, Benjamin V.</author><author>Mann, Daniel H.</author><author>Jones, Benjamin M.</author><author>Wooller, Matthew J.</author><author>Finney, Bruce P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>High-resolution records detect human-caused changes to the boreal forest wildfire regime in interior Alaska</title><secondary-title>Holocene</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Holocene</full-title></periodical><pages>1064-1074</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Alaska</keyword><keyword>wildland–urban interface</keyword><keyword>charcoal</keyword><keyword>wildfire</keyword><keyword>boreal forest</keyword><keyword>anthropogenic disturbance</keyword><keyword>varves</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0959683616632893</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Stand-replacing wildfires are a keystone disturbance in the boreal forest, and they are becoming more common as the climate warms. Paleo-fire archives from the wildland–urban interface can quantify the prehistoric fire regime and assess how both human land-use and climate change impact ecosystem dynamics. Here, we use a combination of a sedimentary charcoal record preserved in varved lake sediments (annually layered) and fire scars in living trees to document changes in local fire return intervals (FRIs) and regional fire activity over the last 500 years. Ace Lake is within the boreal forest, located near the town of Fairbanks in interior Alaska, which was settled by gold miners in AD 1902. In the 400 years before settlement, fires occurred near the lake on average every 58 years. After settlement, fires became much more frequent (average every 18 years), and background charcoal flux rates rose to four times their preindustrial levels, indicating a region-wide increase in burning. Despite this surge in burning, the preindustrial boreal forest ecosystem and permafrost in the watershed have remained intact. Although fire suppression has reduced charcoal influx since the 1950s, an aging fuel load experiencing increasingly warm summers may pose management problems for this and other boreal sites that have similar land-use and fire histories. The large human-caused fire events that we identify can be used to test how increasingly common megafires may alter ecosystem dynamics in the future. © The Author(s) 2016.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70169907</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Weber, Bettina</author><author>Bowker, Matt</author><author>Zhang, Yuanming</author><author>Belnap, Jayne</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Natural Recovery of Biological Soil Crusts After Disturbance</title></titles><pages>479-498</pages><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Springer International Publishing</publisher><urls><web-urls><url>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-30214-0_23</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fischer, A.

Assessments of wildfire risk could benefit from recognizing and accounting for these interactions in terms of socioecological systems, also known as coupled natural and human systems (CNHS). We characterize the primary social and ecological dimensions of the wildfire risk pathology, paying particular attention to the governance system around wildfire risk, and suggest strategies to mitigate the pathology through innovative planning approaches, analytical tools, and policies.

Examining C &amp; nitrogen (N) accumulation rates over decades to centuries may provide additional understanding of the dominant mechanisms for their storage, which can be masked by seasonal and interannual variability when investigated over the short term. We examined longer-term accumulation rates, using Pb-210 and C-14 to date soil layers, for a wide variety of boreal ecosystems: a black spruce forest, a shrub ecosystem, a tussock grass ecosystem, a sedge-dominated ecosystem, and a rich fen. All ecosystems had similar decadal C accumulation rates, averaging 84 +/- 42 gCm(-2) yr(-1). Long-term (century) C accumulation rates were slower than decadal rates, averaging 14 +/- 5 gCm(-2) yr(-1) for all ecosystems except the rich fen, for which the long-term C accumulation rates was more similar to decadal rates (44 +/- 5 and 76 +/- 9 gCm(-2) yr(-1), respectively). The rich fen also had the highest long-term N accumulation rates (2.7 gNm(-2) yr(-1)). The lowest N accumulation rate, on both a decadal and long-term basis, was found in the black spruce forest (0.2 and 1.4 gNm(-2) yr(-1), respectively). Our results suggest that the controls on long-term C and N cycling at the rich fen is fundamentally different from the other ecosystems, likely due to differences in the predominant drivers of nutrient cycling (oxygen availability, for C) and reduced amounts of disturbance by fire (for C and N). This result implies that most shifts in ecosystem vegetation across the boreal region, driven by either climate or succession, will not significantly impact regional C or N dynamics over years to decades. However, ecosystem transitions to or from a rich fen will promote significant shifts in soil C and N storage.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70175676</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Curry, Brandon</author><author>Henne, Paul D.</author><author>Mezquita-Joanes, Francesc</author><author>Marrone, Federico</author><author>Pieri, Valentina</author><author>La Mantia, Tommaso</author><author>Calò, Camilla</author><author>Tinner, Willy</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Holocene paleoclimate inferred from salinity histories of adjacent lakes in southwestern Sicily (Italy)</title><secondary-title>Quaternary Science Reviews</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Quaternary Science Reviews</full-title></periodical><pages>67-83</pages><volume>150</volume><keywords><keyword>Holocene</keyword><keyword>Mediterranean</keyword><keyword>Ostracodes</keyword><keyword>Paleoclimate</keyword><keyword>Paleohydrology</keyword><keyword>Sicily</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.quascirev.2016.08.013</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Marked uncertainties persist regarding the climatic evolution of the Mediterranean region during the Holocene. For instance, whether moisture availability gradually decreased, remained relatively constant, or increased during the last 7000 years remains a matter of debate. To assess Holocene limnology, hydrology and moisture dynamics, the coastal lakes Lago Preola and Gorgo Basso, located in southwestern Sicily, were investigated through several stratigraphic analyses of ostracodes, including multivariate analyses of assemblages, transfer functions of salinity, and biochemical analyses of valves (Sr/Ca, δ18O and δ13C). During the early Holocene, the Gorgo Basso and Lago Preola ostracode records are similar. After an initial period of moderate salinity (1690–6100 mg/l from ca. 10,000–8190 cal yr BP), syndepositional or diagenetic dissolution of ostracode valves suggests that salinity declined to &lt;250 mg/L from ca. 8190 to 7000 cal yr BP at both sites. After ca. 6250 cal yr BP, the ostracode records are strikingly different. Lago Preola became much more saline, with paleosalinity values that ranged from 2270 to about 24,420 mg/L. We suggest that Lago Preola's change from a freshwater to mesosaline lake at about 6250 cal yr BP was related to sea level rise and resulting intrusion of seawater-influenced groundwater. In contrast, Gorgo Basso remained a freshwater lake. The salinity of Gorgo Basso declined somewhat after 6250 cal yr BP, in comparison to the early Holocene, ranging from about 550 to 1680 mg/L. Cypria ophtalmica, a species capable of rapid swimming and flourishing in waters with low dissolved oxygen levels, became dominant at approximately the time when Greek civilization took root in Sicily (2600 cal yr BP), and it completely dominates the record during Roman occupation (roughly 2100 to 1700 cal yr BP). These freshwater conditions at Gorgo Basso suggest high effective moisture when evergreen olive-oak forests collapsed in response to increased Greco-Roman land use and fire. Ostracode valve geochemistry (Sr/Ca, δ18O) suggests significant changes in early vs. late Holocene hydrochemistry, either as changes in salinity or in the seasonality of precipitation. Harmonizing the autecological and geochemical data from Gorgo Basso suggests the latter was more likely, with relatively more late Holocene precipitation falling during the spring, summer, and fall, than winter compared to the early Holocene. Our ostracode-inferred paleosalinity data indicate that moisture availability did not decline during the late Holocene in the central Mediterranean region. Instead, moisture availability was lowest during the early Holocene, and most abundant during the late Holocene.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70176071</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reese, Gordon C</author><author>Manier, Daniel J</author><author>Carr, Natasha B</author><author>Callan, Ramana</author><author>Leinwand, Ian I F</author><author>Assal, Timothy J</author><author>Burris, Lucy</author><author>Ignizio, Drew A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimated historical distribution of grassland communities of the Southern Great Plains</title></titles><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2016-1184</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20161184</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Holbrook, Joseph D.</author><author>Pilliod, David S.</author><author>Arkle, Robert S.</author><author>Rachlow, Janet L.</author><author>Vierling, Kerri T.</author><author>Wiest, Michelle M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transition of Vegetation States Positively Affects Harvester Ants in the Great Basin, United States</title><secondary-title>Rangeland Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Rangeland Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>449-456</pages><volume>69</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Pogonomyrmex</keyword><keyword>Bromus tectorum</keyword><keyword>wildfire</keyword><keyword>biological invasions</keyword><keyword>granivore</keyword><keyword>state transitions</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1550-7424</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.rama.2016.06.009</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Invasions by non-native plants can alter ecosystems such that new ecological states are reached, but less is known about how these transitions influence animal populations. Sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) ecosystems are experiencing state changes because of fire and invasion by exotic annual grasses. Our goal was to study the effects of these state changes on the Owyhee and western harvester ants (Pogonomyrmex salinus Olsen and P. occidentalis Cresson, respectively). We sampled 358 1-ha plots across the northern Great Basin,which captured unburned and burned conditions across 1-31 years postfire. Our results indicated an immediate and consistent change in vegetation states fromshrubland to grassland between 1 and 31 years postfire. Harvester ant occupancy was unrelated to time since fire, whereas we observed a positive effect of fire on nest density. Similarly, we discovered that fire and invasion by exotic annuals were weak predictors of harvester ant occupancy but strong predictors of nest density. Occupancy of harvester ants wasmore likely in areas with finer-textured soils, low precipitation, abundant native forbs, and low shrub cover. Nest densitywas higher in arid locations that recently burned and exhibited abundant exotic annual and perennial (exotic and native) grasses. Finally,we discovered that burned areas that received postfire restoration had minimal influence on harvester ant occupancy or nest density compared with burned and untreated areas. These results suggest that fire-induced state changes from native shrublands to grasslands dominated by non-native grasses have a positive effect on density of harvester ants (but not occupancy), and that postfire restoration does not appear to positively or negatively affect harvester ants. Although wildfire and invasion by exotic annual grasses may negatively affect other species, harvester ants may indeed be one of the few winners among a myriad of losers linked to vegetation state changes within sagebrush ecosystems.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70175980</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kendrick, Katherine J.</author><author>Partin, Camille A.</author><author>Graham, Robert C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Granitic Boulder Erosion Caused by Chaparral Wildfire: Implications for Cosmogenic Radionuclide Dating of Bedrock Surfaces</title><secondary-title>The Journal of Geology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of Geology</full-title></periodical><pages>529-539</pages><volume>124</volume><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1086/686273</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/686273</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Harper, Craig A.</author><author>Ford, W.

However, questions persist as to how fire affects hardwood forest communities and associated wildlife, and how fire should be used to achieve management goals. We provide an up-to-date review of fire effects on various wildlife species and their habitat in the Central Hardwoods and Appalachians. Documented direct effects (i.e., mortality) on wildlife are rare. Indirect effects (i.e., changes in habitat quality) are influenced greatly by light availability, fire frequency, and fire intensity. Unless fire intensity is great enough to kill a portion of the overstory, burning in closed-canopy forests has provided little benefit for most wildlife species in the region because it doesn’t result in enough sunlight penetration to elicit understory response. Canopy reduction through silvicultural treatment has enabled managers to use fire more effectively. Fire intensity must be kept low in hardwoods to limit damage to many species of overstory trees. However, wounding or killing trees with fire benefits many wildlife species by allowing increased sunlight to stimulate understory response, snag and subsequent cavity creation, and additions of large coarse woody debris. In general, a fire-return interval of 2 yr to 7 yr benefits a wide variety of wildlife species by providing a diverse structure in the understory, increasing browse, forage, and soft mast, and creating snags and cavities. Historically, dormant-season fire was most prevalent in these regions, and it still is when most prescribed fire is implemented in hardwood systems as burn-days are relatively few in the growing season of May through August because of shading from leaf cover and high fuel moisture. Late growing-season burning increases the window for burning, and better control on woody composition is possible. Early growing-season fire may pose increased risk for some species, especially herpetofauna recently emerged from winter hibernacula (April) or forest songbirds that nest in the understory (May to June). However, negative population-level effects are unlikely unless the burned area is relatively large and early growing-season fire is used continually. We did not find evidence that fire is leading to population declines for any species, including Endangered Species Act (ESA)-listed species (e.g., Indiana bat [Myotis sodalis Mill. Allen] or northern long-eared bat [M. septentrionalis Trouess.]). Instead, data indicate that fire can enhance habitat for bats by increasing suitability of foraging and day-roost sites. Similarly, concern over burning and displacement of woodland salamanders (Plethodontidae), another taxa of heightened conservation concern, is alleviated when fire is prescribed along ecologically appropriate aspect and slope gradients and not forced into mesic, high site index environments where salamanders are most common. Because topography across the Central Hardwoods and Appalachians is diverse, we contend that applying fire on positions best suited for burning is an effective approach to increase regional landscape heterogeneity and biological diversity. Herein, we offer prescriptive concepts for burning for various wildlife species and guilds in the Central Hardwoods and Appalachians.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70182787</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Speiran, Gary K</author><author>Wurster, Frederick C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spatial differences in hydrologic characteristics and water chemistry of a temperate coastal plain peatland: The Great Dismal Swamp, USA</title></titles><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70169908</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Webster, Jackson P.</author><author>Kane, Tyler J.</author><author>Obrist, Daniel</author><author>Ryan, Joseph N.</author><author>Aiken, George R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating mercury emissions resulting from wildfire in forests of the Western United States</title><secondary-title>Science of the Total Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science of the Total Environment</full-title></periodical><pages>578-586</pages><volume>568</volume><keywords><keyword>Fire severity</keyword><keyword>FOFEM</keyword><keyword>Soil heating</keyword><keyword>Soil mercury</keyword><keyword>Western North America Mercury Synthesis</keyword><keyword>WNAMS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.01.166</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Understanding the emissions of mercury (Hg) from wildfires is important for quantifying the global atmospheric Hg sources. Emissions of Hg from soils resulting from wildfires in the Western United States was estimated for the 2000 to 2013 period, and the potential emission of Hg from forest soils was assessed as a function of forest type and soil-heating. Wildfire released an annual average of 3100 ± 1900 kg-Hg y− 1for the years spanning 2000–2013 in the 11 states within the study area. This estimate is nearly 5-fold lower than previous estimates for the study region. Lower emission estimates are attributed to an inclusion of fire severity within burn perimeters. Within reported wildfire perimeters, the average distribution of low, moderate, and high severity burns was 52, 29, and 19% of the total area, respectively. Review of literature data suggests that that low severity burning does not result in soil heating, moderate severity fire results in shallow soil heating, and high severity fire results in relatively deep soil heating (&lt; 5 cm). Using this approach, emission factors for high severity burns ranged from 58 to 640 μg-Hg kg-fuel− 1. In contrast, low severity burns have emission factors that are estimated to be only 18–34 μg-Hg kg-fuel− 1. In this estimate, wildfire is predicted to release 1–30 g Hg ha− 1from Western United States forest soils while above ground fuels are projected to contribute an additional 0.9 to 7.8 g Hg ha− 1. Land cover types with low biomass (desert scrub) are projected to release less than 1 g Hg ha− 1. Following soil sources, fuel source contributions to total Hg emissions generally followed the order of duff &gt; wood &gt; foliage &gt; litter &gt; branches.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70189513</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Swetnam, Thomas W.</author><author>Farella, Joshua</author><author>Roos, Christopher I.</author><author>Liebmann, Matthew J.</author><author>Falk, Donald A.</author><author>Allen, Craig D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multiscale perspectives of fire, climate and humans in western North America and the Jemez Mountains, USA</title><secondary-title>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>20150168-20150168</pages><volume>371</volume><issue>1696</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1098/rstb.2015.0168</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Interannual climate variations have been important drivers of wildfire occurrence in ponderosa pine forests across western North America for at least 400 years, but at finer scales of mountain ranges and landscapes human land uses sometimes over-rode climate influences. We reconstruct and analyse effects of high human population densities in forests of the Jemez Mountains, New Mexico from ca 1300 CE to Present. Prior to the 1680 Pueblo Revolt, human land uses reduced the occurrence of widespread fires while simultaneously adding more ignitions resulting in many small-extent fires. During the 18th and 19th centuries, wet/dry oscillations and their effects on fuels dynamics controlled widespread fire occurrence. In the late 19th century, intensive livestock grazing disrupted fuels continuity and fire spread and then active fire suppression maintained the absence of widespread surface fires during most of the 20th century. The abundance and continuity of fuels is the most important controlling variable in fire regimes of these semi-arid forests. Reduction of widespread fires owing to reduction of fuel continuity emerges as a hallmark of extensive human impacts on past forests and fire regimes.This article is part of the themed issue {\textquoteleft}The interaction of fire and mankind{\textquoteright}.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/lookup/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0168</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brown, Dana R.N.</author><author>Jorgenson, Mark T.</author><author>Kielland, Knut</author><author>Verbyla, David L.</author><author>Prakash, Anupma</author><author>Koch, Joshua C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Landscape effects of wildfire on permafrost distribution in interior Alaska derived from remote sensing</title><secondary-title>Remote Sensing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Remote Sensing</full-title></periodical><pages>1-22</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Boreal forest</keyword><keyword>Alaska</keyword><keyword>Permafrost</keyword><keyword>Remote sensing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/rs8080654</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Climate change coupled with an intensifying wildfire regime is becoming an important driver of permafrost loss and ecosystem change in the northern boreal forest. There is a growing need to understand the effects of fire on the spatial distribution of permafrost and its associated ecological consequences. We focus on the effects of fire a decade after disturbance in a rocky upland landscape in the interior Alaskan boreal forest. Our main objectives were to (1) map near-surface permafrost distribution and drainage classes and (2) analyze the controls over landscape-scale patterns of post-fire permafrost degradation. Relationships among remote sensing variables and field-based data on soil properties (temperature, moisture, organic layer thickness) and vegetation (plant community composition) were analyzed using correlation, regression, and ordination analyses. The remote sensing data we considered included spectral indices from optical datasets (Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI)), the principal components of a time series of radar backscatter (Advanced Land Observing Satellite—Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS-PALSAR)), and topographic variables from a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-derived digital elevation model (DEM). We found strong empirical relationships between the normalized difference infrared index (NDII) and post-fire vegetation, soil moisture, and soil temperature, enabling us to indirectly map permafrost status and drainage class using regression-based models. The thickness of the insulating surface organic layer after fire, a measure of burn severity, was an important control over the extent of permafrost degradation. According to our classifications, 90% of the area considered to have experienced high severity burn (using the difference normalized burn ratio (dNBR)) lacked permafrost after fire. Permafrost thaw, in turn, likely increased drainage and resulted in drier surface soils. Burn severity also influenced plant community composition, which was tightly linked to soil temperature and moisture. Overall, interactions between burn severity, topography, and vegetation appear to control the distribution of near-surface permafrost and associated drainage conditions after disturbance.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70185063</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Margolis, Ellis Q.</author><author>Malevich, Steven B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Historical dominance of low-severity fire in dry and wet mixed-conifer forest habitats of the endangered terrestrial Jemez Mountains salamander (Plethodon neomexicanus)</title><secondary-title>Forest Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forest Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>12-26</pages><volume>375</volume><keywords><keyword>Fire history</keyword><keyword>Douglas-fir</keyword><keyword>Dendroecology</keyword><keyword>Endangered species</keyword><keyword>Fire-climate relationships</keyword><keyword>Mixed-severity fire regime</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0378-1127</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.foreco.2016.05.011</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Anthropogenic alteration of ecosystem processes confounds forest management and conservation of rare, declining species. Restoration of forest structure and fire hazard reduction are central goals of forest management policy in the western United States, but restoration priorities and treatments have become increasingly contentious. Numerous studies have documented changes in fire regimes, forest stand structure and species composition following a century of fire exclusion in dry, frequent-fire forests of the western U.S. (e.g., ponderosa pine and dry mixed-conifer). In contrast, wet mixed-conifer forests are thought to have historically burned infrequently with mixed- or high-severity fire-resulting in reduced impacts from fire exclusion and low restoration need-but data are limited. In this study we quantified the current forest habitat of the federally endangered, terrestrial Jemez Mountains salamander (Plethodon neomexicanus) and compared it to dendroecological reconstructions of historical habitat (e.g., stand structure and composition), and fire regime parameters along a gradient from upper ponderosa pine to wet mixed-conifer forests. We found that current fire-free intervals in Jemez Mountains salamander habitat (116-165 years) are significantly longer than historical intervals, even in wet mixed-conifer forests. Historical mean fire intervals ranged from 10 to 42 years along the forest gradient. Low-severity fires were historically dominant across all forest types (92 of 102 fires). Although some mixed- or high-severity fire historically occurred at 67% of the plots over the last four centuries, complete mortality within 1.0 ha plots was rare, and asynchronous within and among sites. Climate was an important driver of temporal variability in fire severity, such that mixed- and high-severity fires were associated with more extreme drought than low-severity fires. Tree density in dry conifer forests historically ranged from open (90 trees ha-1) to moderately dense (400 trees ha-1), but has doubled on average since fire exclusion. Infill of fire-sensitive tree species has contributed to the conversion of historically dry mixed-conifer to wet mixed-conifer forest. We conclude that low-severity fire, which has been absent for over a century, was a critical ecosystem process across the forest gradient in Jemez Mountains salamander habitat, and thus is an important element of ecosystem restoration, resilience, and rare species recovery.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70175391</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keeley, Jon</author><author>Syphard, Alexandra</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Climate Change and Future Fire Regimes: Examples from California</title><secondary-title>Geosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geosciences</full-title></periodical><pages>37-37</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2076-3263</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/geosciences6030037</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Climate and weather have long been noted as playing key roles in wildfire activity, and global warming is expected to exacerbate fire impacts on natural and urban ecosystems. Predicting future fire regimes requires an understanding of how temperature and precipitation interact to control fire activity. Inevitably this requires historical analyses that relate annual burning to climate variation. Fuel structure plays a critical role in determining which climatic parameters are most influential on fire activity, and here, by focusing on the diversity of ecosystems in California, we illustrate some principles that need to be recognized in predicting future fire regimes. Spatial scale of analysis is important in that large heterogeneous landscapes may not fully capture accurate relationships between climate and fires. Within climatically homogeneous subregions, montane forested landscapes show strong relationships between annual fluctuations in temperature and precipitation with area burned; however, this is strongly seasonal dependent; e.g., winter temperatures have very little or no effect but spring and summer temperatures are critical. Climate models that predict future seasonal temperature changes are needed to improve fire regime projections. Climate does not appear to be a major determinant of fire activity on all landscapes. Lower elevations and lower latitudes show little or no increase in fire activity with hotter and drier conditions. On these landscapes climate is not usually limiting to fires but these vegetation types are ignition-limited. Moreover, because they are closely juxtaposed with human habitations, fire regimes are more strongly controlled by other direct anthropogenic impacts. Predicting future fire regimes is not rocket science; it is far more complicated than that. Climate change is not relevant to some landscapes, but where climate is relevant, the relationship will change due to direct climate effects on vegetation trajectories, as well as by feedback processes of fire effects on vegetation distribution, plus policy changes in how we manage ecosystems.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.mdpi.com/2076-3263/6/3/37</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mckerrow, Alexa</author><author>Dewitz, Jon</author><author>Long, Don</author><author>Nelson, Kurtis</author><author>Connot, Joel</author><author>Smith, Jim</author><author>Survey, U S Geological</author><author>Analytics, Core Science</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Comparison of NLCD 2011 and LANDFIRE EVT 2010 : Regional and National Summaries .

Sagebrush ecosystems support numerous species, and it is important to understand those factors that affect rates of post-fire sagebrush recovery. We explored recovery of Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis) and basin big sagebrush (A. tridentata ssp. tridentata) communities following fire in the northern Columbia Basin (Washington, USA). We sampled plots across 16 fires that burned in big sagebrush communities from 5 to 28 years ago, and also sampled nearby unburned locations. Mixed-effects models demonstrated that density of large-mature big sagebrush plants and percentage cover of big sagebrush were higher with time since fire and in plots with more precipitation during the winter immediately following fire, but were lower when precipitation the next winter was higher than average, especially on soils with higher available water supply, and with greater post-fire mortality of mature big sagebrush plants. Bunchgrass cover 5 to 28 years after fire was predicted to be lower with higher cover of both shrubs and non-native herbaceous species, and only slightly higher with time. Post-fire recovery of big sagebrush in the northern Columbia Basin is a slow process that may require several decades on average, but faster recovery rates may occur under specific site and climate conditions.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70174973</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xiao, Jingfeng</author><author>Liu, Shuguang</author><author>Stoy, Paul C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Preface: Impacts of extreme climate events and disturbances on carbon dynamics</title><secondary-title>Biogeosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biogeosciences</full-title></periodical><pages>3665-3675</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>12</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/bg-13-3665-2016</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The impacts of disturbances and extreme climate on the carbon cycle have received growing attention in recent years as evidenced by the increasing number of journal articles published on these topics. This special issue showcases a collection of recent advancements in understanding the impacts of disturbances and extreme events on the carbon cycle. Notable advancements include, but are not limited to, quantifying how harvesting activities impact forest structure, carbon pool dynamics, and recovery processes; observed drastic increases of the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and dissolved methane in thermokarst lakes in western Siberia in a summer warming event; disentangling the roles of herbivores and fire on forest carbon dioxide flux; direct and indirect impacts of fire on the global carbon balance; and improved atmospheric inversion of regional carbon sources and sinks byincorporating disturbances. Combined, studies herein indicate several major research needs. First, disturbances and extreme events can interact with one another, and it is important to understand their overall impacts and also disentangle their relative effects on the carbon cycle. Second, benchmark data layers characterizing the timing, location, type, and magnitude of disturbances must be systematically created to improve our ability to quantify carbon dynamics over large areas. Third, current ecosystem models are not skillful enough to correctly simulate the impacts of disturbances such as disturbance-induced tree mortality and its carbon consequences, and therefore must be improved to correctly represent underlying processes and impacts.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70187758</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rundel, Philip W.</author><author>Arroyo, Mary T.K.</author><author>Cowling, Richard M.</author><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author><author>Lamont, Byron B.</author><author>Vargas, Pablo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mediterranean Biomes: Evolution of Their Vegetation, Floras, and Climate</title><secondary-title>Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics</full-title></periodical><pages>383-407</pages><volume>47</volume><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-121415-032330</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Mediterranean-type ecosystems (MTEs) possess the highest levels of plant species richness in the world outside of the wet tropics. Sclerophyll vegetation similar to today’s mediterranean-type shrublands was already present on oligotrophic soils in the wet and humid climate of the Cretaceous, with fire-adapted Paleogene lineages in southwestern Australia and the Cape Region. The novel MTC seasonality present since the mid-Miocene has allowed colonization of MTEs from a regional species pool with associated diversification.

In this research paper we describe the temporal response of grassland communities to drought and fire in southern Arizona, where land managers are using repeated, prescribed fire as a habitat restoration tool. Using a 25-year atlas of fire locations, we paired sites with multiple fires to unburned control areas and compare satellite and field-based estimates of vegetation cover over time. Two hundred and fifty Landsat TM images, dating from 1985-2011, were used to derive estimates of Total Vegetation Fractional Cover (TVFC) of live and senescent grass using the Soil-Adjusted Total Vegetation Index (SATVI) and post-fire vegetation greenness using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We also implemented a Greenness to Cover Index that is the difference of time-standardized SATVI-TVFC and NDVI values at a given time and location to identify post-fire shifts in native, non-native, and annual plant cover. The results highlight anomalous greening and browning during drought periods related to amounts of annual and non-native plant cover present. Results suggest that aggressive application of prescribed fire may encourage spread of non-native perennial grasses and annual plants, particularly during droughts.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70176714</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Flitcroft, Rebecca L.</author><author>Falke, Jeffrey A.</author><author>Reeves, Gordon H.</author><author>Hessburg, Paul F.</author><author>McNyset, Kris M.</author><author>Benda, Lee E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Wildfire may increase habitat quality for spring Chinook salmon in the Wenatchee River subbasin, WA, USA</title><secondary-title>Forest Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forest Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>126-140</pages><volume>359</volume><keywords><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Bayesian model</keyword><keyword>Life stages</keyword><keyword>Population resilience</keyword><keyword>Spring Chinook salmon</keyword><keyword>Watershed-scale</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0378-1127</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.foreco.2015.09.049</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Pacific Northwest salmonids are adapted to natural disturbance regimes that create dynamic habitat patterns over space and through time. However, human land use, particularly long-term fire suppression, has altered the intensity and frequency of wildfire in forested upland and riparian areas. To examine the potential impacts of wildfire on aquatic systems, we developed stream-reach-scale models of freshwater habitat for three life stages (adult, egg/fry, and juvenile) of spring Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Wenatchee River subbasin, Washington. We used variables representing pre- and post-fire habitat conditions and employed novel techniques to capture changes in in-stream fine sediment, wood, and water temperature. Watershed-scale comparisons of high-quality habitat for each life stage of spring Chinook salmon habitat suggested that there are smaller quantities of high-quality juvenile overwinter habitat as compared to habitat for other life stages. We found that wildfire has the potential to increase quality of adult and overwintering juvenile habitat through increased delivery of wood, while decreasing the quality of egg and fry habitat due to the introduction of fine sediments. Model results showed the largest effect of fire on habitat quality associated with the juvenile life stage, resulting in increases in high-quality habitat in all watersheds. Due to the limited availability of pre-fire high-quality juvenile habitat, and increased habitat quality for this life stage post-fire, occurrence of characteristic wildfires would likely create a positive effect on spring Chinook salmon habitat in the Wenatchee River subbasin. We also compared pre- and post-fire model results of freshwater habitat for each life stage, and for the geometric mean of habitat quality across all life stages, using current compared to the historic distribution of spring Chinook salmon. We found that spring Chinook salmon are currently distributed in stream channels in which in-stream habitat for most life stages has a consistently positive response to fire. This compares to the historic distribution of spring Chinook, in which in-stream habitat exhibited a variable response to fire, including decreases in habitat quality overall or for specific life stages. This suggests that as the distribution of spring Chinook has decreased, they now occupy those areas with the most positive potential response to fire. Our work shows the potentially positive link between wildfire and aquatic habitat that supports forest managers in setting broader goals for fire management, perhaps leading to less fire suppression in some situations.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70173788</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ford, W.

Common prior to white-nose syndrome, the population of this bat species has declined to functional ex- tirpation in some regions in the North- east and Mid-Atlantic, including por- tions of the central Appalachians. Our long-term research in the central Ap- palachians has shown that maternity colonies of this species form non-ran- dom assorting networks in patches of suitable trees that result from long- and short-term forest disturbance pro- cesses, and that roost loss can occur with these disturbances. Following two consecutive prescribed burns on the Fernow Experimental Forest in the central Appalachians, West Virginia, USA, in 2007 to 2008, post-fire counts of suitable black locust (Robinia pseu- doacacia L.; the most selected species for roosting) slightly decreased by 2012. Conversely, post-fire numbers of suitable maple (Acer spp. L.), pri- marily red maple (Acer rubrum L.), in- creased by a factor of three, thereby ameliorating black locust reduction. Maternity colony network metrics such as roost degree (use) and network density for two networks in the burned compartment were similar to the single network observed in unburned forest. However, roost clustering and degree of roost centralization was greater for the networks in the burned forest area. Accordingly, the short-term effects of prescribed fire are slightly or moder- ately positive in impact to day-roost habitat for the northern long-eared bat in the central Appalachians from a so- cial dynamic perspective. Listing of northern long-eared bats as federally threatened will bring increased scruti- ny of immediate fire impacts from di- rect take as well as indirect impacts from long-term changes to roosting and foraging habitat in stands being returned to historic fire-return condi- tions. Unfortunately, definitive im- pacts will remain speculative owing to the species’ current rarity and the pau- city of forest stand data that considers tree condition or that adequately tracks snags spatially and temporally.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70182786</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ashton, Isabel W.</author><author>Symstad, Amy J.</author><author>Davis, Christopher J.</author><author>Swanson, Daniel J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Preserving prairies: Understanding temporal and spatial patterns of invasive annual bromes in the Northern Great Plains</title><secondary-title>Ecosphere</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecosphere</full-title></periodical><volume>7</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire effects</keyword><keyword>Cheatgrass</keyword><keyword>Adaptive management</keyword><keyword>Japanese brome</keyword><keyword>Nitrogen deposition</keyword><keyword>Special feature: science for our national parks' s</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2150-8925</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/ecs2.1438</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Two Eurasian invasive annual brome grasses, cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) and Japanese brome (Bromus japonicus), are well known for their impact in steppe ecosystems of the western United States where these grasses have altered fire regimes, reduced native plant diversity and abundance, and degraded wildlife habitat. Annual bromes are also abundant in the grasslands of the Northern Great Plains (NGP), but their impact and ecology are not as well studied. It is unclear whether the lessons learned from the steppe will translate to the mixed-grass prairie where native plant species are adapted to frequent fires and grazing. Developing a successful annual brome management strategy for National Park Service units and other NGP grasslands requires better understanding of (1) the impact of annual bromes on grassland condition; (2) the dynamics of these species through space and time; and (3) the relative importance of environmental factors within and outside managers' control for these spatiotemporal dynamics. Here, we use vegetation monitoring data collected from 1998 to 2015 in 295 sites to relate spatiotemporal variability of annual brome grasses to grassland composition, weather, physical environmental characteristics, and ecological processes (grazing and fire). Concern about the impact of these species in NGP grasslands is warranted, as we found a decline in native species richness with increasing annual brome cover. Annual brome cover generally increased over the time of monitoring but also displayed a 3- to 5-yr cycle of reduction and resurgence. Relative cover of annual bromes in the monitored areas was best predicted by park unit, weather, extant plant community, slope grade, soil composition, and fire history. We found no evidence that grazing reduced annual brome cover, but this may be due to the relatively low grazing pressure in our study. By understanding the consequences and patterns of annual brome invasion, we will be better able to preserve and restore these grassland landscapes for future generations.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70175943</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Carr, Joel</author><author>D'Odorico, Paolo</author><author>Engel, Victor</author><author>Redwine, Jed</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tree island pattern formation in the Florida Everglades</title><secondary-title>Ecological Complexity</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Complexity</full-title></periodical><pages>37-44</pages><volume>26</volume><keywords><keyword>Ecohydrology</keyword><keyword>Fires</keyword><keyword>Ecogeomorphic feedbacks</keyword><keyword>Pattern formation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ecocom.2016.03.007</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Florida Everglades freshwater landscape exhibits a distribution of islands covered by woody vegetation and bordered by marshes and wet prairies. Known as "tree islands", these ecogeomorphic features can be found in few other low gradient, nutrient limited freshwater wetlands. In the last few decades, however, a large percentage of tree islands have either shrank or disappeared in apparent response to altered water depths and other stressors associated with human impacts on the Everglades. Because the processes determining the formation and spatial organization of tree islands remain poorly understood, it is still unclear what controls the sensitivity of these landscapes to altered conditions. We hypothesize that positive feedbacks between woody plants and soil accretion are crucial to emergence and decline of tree islands. Likewise, positive feedbacks between phosphorus (P) accumulation and trees explain the P enrichment commonly observed in tree island soils. Here, we develop a spatially-explicit model of tree island formation and evolution, which accounts for these positive feedbacks (facilitation) as well as for long range competition and fire dynamics. It is found that tree island patterns form within a range of parameter values consistent with field data. Simulated impacts of reduced water levels, increased intensity of drought, and increased frequency of dry season/soil consuming fires on these feedback mechanisms result in the decline and disappearance of tree islands on the landscape.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70170325</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brenner, Owen T</author><author>Hapke, Cheryl J</author><author>Lee, Kathryn G</author><author>Kimbrow, Dustin R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Terrestrial-based lidar beach topography of Fire Island, New York, June 2014</title></titles><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>980</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ds980</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rose, Eli T.</author><author>Simons, Theodore R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Avian response to fire in pine–oak forests of Great Smoky Mountains National Park following decades of fire suppression</title><secondary-title>The Condor</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Condor</full-title></periodical><pages>179-193</pages><volume>118</volume><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1650/CONDOR-15-85.1</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.bioone.org/doi/10.1650/CONDOR-15-85.1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Glenn, Nancy F.</author><author>Neuenschwander, Amy</author><author>Vierling, Lee A.</author><author>Spaete, Lucas</author><author>Li, Aihua</author><author>Shinneman, Douglas J.</author><author>Pilliod, David S.</author><author>Arkle, Robert S.</author><author>McIlroy, Susan K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Landsat 8 and ICESat-2: Performance and potential synergies for quantifying dryland ecosystem vegetation cover and biomass</title><secondary-title>Remote Sensing of Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Remote Sensing of Environment</full-title></periodical><pages>233-242</pages><volume>185</volume><keywords><keyword>Above-ground biomass</keyword><keyword>ATLAS</keyword><keyword>ICESat-2</keyword><keyword>MABEL</keyword><keyword>OLI</keyword><keyword>Shrub</keyword><keyword>TM</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0034-4257</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.rse.2016.02.039</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Landsat 8 mission provides new opportunities for quantifying the distribution of above-ground carbon at moderate spatial resolution across the globe, and in particular drylands. Furthermore, coupled with structural information from space-based and airborne laser altimetry, Landsat 8 provides powerful capabilities for large-area, long-term studies that quantify temporal and spatial changes in above-ground biomass and cover. With the planned launch of ICESat-2 in 2017 and thus the potential to couple Landsat 8 and ICESat-2 data, we have unprecedented opportunities to address key challenges in drylands, including quantifying fuel loads, habitat quality, biodiversity, carbon cycling, and desertification. In this study, we explore the strengths of Landsat 8's Operational Land Imager (OLI) in estimating vegetation structure in a dryland ecosystem, and compare these results to Landsat 5's Thematic Mapper (TM). We also demonstrate the potential of OLI when coupled with light detection and ranging (lidar) in estimating vegetation cover and biomass in a dryland ecosystem. The OLI and TM predictions were similarly positive, indicating data from these sensors may be used in tandem for long-term time-series analysis. Results indicate shrub and herbaceous cover are well predicted with multi-temporal OLI data, and a combination of OLI and lidar derivatives improves most of these estimates and reduces uncertainty. For example, significant improvements were made for shrub cover (R2= 0.64 and 0.78 using OLI only and both OLI and lidar data, respectively). Importantly, a time series of OLI, with some improvement from lidar, provides strong estimates of herbaceous cover (68% of the variance is explained with OLI alone). In contrast, OLI data explain roughly 59% of the variance in total shrub biomass, however approximately 71% of the variance is explained when combined with lidar derivatives. To estimate the potential synergies of OLI and ICESat-2 we used simulated ICESat-2 photon data to predict vegetation structure. In a shrubland environment with a vegetation mean height of 1 m and mean vegetation cover of 33%, vegetation photons are able to explain nearly 50% of the variance in vegetation height. These results, and those from a comparison site, suggest that a lower detection threshold of ICESat-2 may be in the range of 30% canopy cover and roughly 1 m height in comparable dryland environments and these detection thresholds could be used to combine future ICESat-2 photon data with OLI spectral data for improved vegetation structure. Overall, the synergistic use of Landsat 8 and ICESat-2 may improve estimates of above-ground biomass and carbon storage in drylands that meet these minimum thresholds, increasing our ability to monitor drylands for fuel loading and the potential to sequester carbon.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70171046</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Caputo, Jesse</author><author>Beier, Colin M.</author><author>Groffman, Peter M.</author><author>Burns, Douglas A.</author><author>Beall, Frederick D.</author><author>Hazlett, Paul W.</author><author>Yorks, Thad E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of Harvesting Forest Biomass on Water and Climate Regulation Services: A Synthesis of Long-Term Ecosystem Experiments in Eastern North America</title><secondary-title>Ecosystems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecosystems</full-title></periodical><pages>271-283</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>ecosystem services</keyword><keyword>climate regulation</keyword><keyword>forest biomass</keyword><keyword>forest recovery</keyword><keyword>tradeoff analysis</keyword><keyword>water regulation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1432-9840</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10021-015-9928-z</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Demand for woody biomass fuels is increasing amidst concerns about global energy security and climate change, but there may be negative implications of increased harvesting for forest ecosystem functions and their benefits to society (ecosystem services). Using new methods for assessing ecosystem services based on long-term experimental research, post-harvest changes in ten potential benefits were assessed for ten first-order northern hardwood forest watersheds at three long-term experimental research sites in northeastern North America. As expected, we observed near-term tradeoffs between biomass provision and greenhouse gas regulation, as well as tradeoffs between intensive harvest and the capacity of the forest to remediate nutrient pollution. In both cases, service provision began to recover along with the regeneration of forest vegetation; in the case of pollution remediation, the service recovered to pre-harvest levels within 10 years. By contrast to these two services, biomass harvesting had relatively nominal and transient impacts on other ecosystem services. Our results are sensitive to empirical definitions of societal demand, including methods for scaling societal demand to ecosystem units, which are often poorly resolved. Reducing uncertainty around these parameters can improve confidence in our results and increase their relevance for decision-making. Our synthesis of long-term experimental studies provides insights on the social-ecological resilience of managed forest ecosystems to multiple drivers of change.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70170543</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kelly, Ryan</author><author>Genet, Hélène</author><author>McGuire, A.

However, these predictions may be compromised because brief observational records provide limited constraints to model initial conditions. We confronted this limitation by using palaeoenvironmental data to drive simulations of long-term C dynamics in the Alaskan boreal forest. Results show that fire was the dominant control on C cycling over the past millennium, with changes in fire frequency accounting for 84% of C stock variability. A recent rise in fire frequency inferred from the palaeorecord led to simulated C losses of 1.4 kgCm-2 (12% of ecosystem C stocks) from 1950 to 2006. In stark contrast, a small net C sink of 0.3 kgCm-2 occurred if the past fire regime was assumed to be similar to the modern regime, as is common in models of C dynamics. Although boreal fire regimes are heterogeneous, recent trends and future projections point to increasing fire activity in response to climate warming throughout the biome. Thus, predictions that terrestrial C sinks of northern high latitudes will mitigate rising atmospheric CO2 may be over-optimistic.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70168350</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Martin, Deborah A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>At the nexus of fire, water and society</title><secondary-title>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>20150172-20150172</pages><volume>371</volume><issue>1696</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1098/rstb.2015.0172</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/lookup/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0172</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Staley, Dennis M.</author><author>Negri, Jacquelyn A.</author><author>Kean, Jason W.</author><author>Laber, Jayme L.</author><author>Tillery, Anne C.</author><author>Youberg, Ann M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Updated logistic regression equations for the calculation of post-fire debris-flow likelihood in the western United States</title></titles><pages>17-17</pages><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2016-1106</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20161106</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Soulard, Christopher E.</author><author>Albano, Christine M.</author><author>Villarreal, Miguel L.</author><author>Walker, Jessica J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Continuous 1985-2012 Landsat monitoring to assess fire effects on meadows in Yosemite National Park, California</title><secondary-title>Remote Sensing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Remote Sensing</full-title></periodical><volume>8</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Landsat</keyword><keyword>Sierra Nevada</keyword><keyword>Vegetation change</keyword><keyword>Yosemite</keyword><keyword>NDVI</keyword><keyword>Google Earth Engine</keyword><keyword>Meadow</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1650329431</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/rs8050371</electronic-resource-num><abstract>? 2016 by the authors.To assess how montane meadow vegetation recovered after a wildfire that occurred in Yosemite National Park, CA in 1996, Google Earth Engine image processing was applied to leverage the entire Landsat Thematic Mapper archive from 1985 to 2012. Vegetation greenness (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)) was summarized every 16 days across the 28-year Landsat time series for 26 meadows. Disturbance event detection was hindered by the subtle influence of low-severity fire on meadow vegetation. A hard break (August 1996) was identified corresponding to the Ackerson Fire, and monthly composites were used to compare NDVI values and NDVI trends within burned and unburned meadows before, immediately after, and continuously for more than a decade following the fire date. Results indicate that NDVI values were significantly lower at 95% confidence level for burned meadows following the fire date, yet not significantly lower at 95% confidence level in the unburned meadows. Burned meadows continued to exhibit lower monthly NDVI in the dormant season through 2012. Over the entire monitoring period, the negative-trending, dormant season NDVI slopes in the burned meadows were also significantly lower than unburned meadows at 90% confidence level. Lower than average NDVI values and slopes in the dormant season compared to unburned meadows, coupled with photographic evidence, strongly suggest that evergreen vegetation was removed from the periphery of some meadows after the fire. These analyses provide insight into how satellite imagery can be used to monitor low-severity fire effects on meadow vegetation.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70171057</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Van Mantgem, Phillip J.</author><author>Caprio, Anthony C.</author><author>Stephenson, Nathan L.</author><author>Das, Adrian J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Does prescribed fire promote resistance to drought in low elevation forests of the Sierra Nevada, California, USA?</title><secondary-title>Fire Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Fire Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>13-25</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire effects</keyword><keyword>Prescribed fire</keyword><keyword>Forest management</keyword><keyword>Sierra Nevada</keyword><keyword>Drought</keyword><keyword>Tree mortality</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1933-9747</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.4996/fireecology.1201013</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Prescribed fire is a primary tool used to restore western forests following more than a century of fire exclusion, reducing fire hazard by removing dead and live fuels (small trees and shrubs). It is commonly assumed that the reduced forest density following prescribed fire also reduces competition for resources among the remaining trees, so that the remaining trees are more resistant (more likely to survive) in the face of additional stressors, such as drought. Yet this proposition remains largely untested, so that managers do not have the basic information to evaluate whether prescribed fire may help forests adapt to a future of more frequent and severe drought. During the third year of drought, in 2014, we surveyed 9950 trees in 38 burned and 18 unburned mixed conifer forest plots at low elevation (&lt; 2100 m a.s.l.) in Kings Canyon, Sequoia, and Yosemite national parks in California, USA. Fire had occurred in the burned plots from 6 yr to 28 yr be-fore our survey. After accounting for differences in individual tree diameter, common conifer species found in the burned plots had significantly reduced probability of mortality compared to unburned plots during the drought. Stand density (stems ha(-1)) was significantly lower in burned versus unburned sites, supporting the idea that reduced competition may be responsible for the differential drought mortality response. At the time of writing, we are not sure if burned stands will maintain lower tree mortality probabilities in the face of the continued, severe drought of 2015. Future work should aim to better identify drought response mechanisms and how these may vary across other forest types and regions, particularly in other areas experiencing severe drought in the Sierra Nevada and on the Colorado Plateau.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70170396</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rengers, F.

Fire fragments the shrub steppe and reduces its capacity to provide forage for livestock and wildlife and habitat critical to sagebrush obligates. Of particular interest is the greater sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), an obligate whose populations have declined so severely due, in part, to increases in cheatgrass and fires that it was considered for inclusion as an endangered species. Remote sensing technologies and satellite archives help scientists monitor terrestrial vegetation globally, including cheatgrass in the Northern Great Basin. Along with geospatial analysis and advanced spatial modeling, these data and technologies can identify areas susceptible to increased cheatgrass cover and compare these with greater sage grouse priority areas for conservation (PAC). Future climate models forecast a warmer and wetter climate for the Northern Great Basin, which likely will force changing cheatgrass dynamics. Therefore, we examine potential climate-caused changes to cheatgrass. Our results indicate that future cheatgrass percent cover will remain stable over more than 80% of the study area when compared with recent estimates, and higher overall cheatgrass cover will occur with slightly more spatial variability. The land area projected to increase or decrease in cheatgrass cover equals 18% and 1%, respectively, malking an increase in fire disturbances in greater sage grouse habitat likely. Relative susceptibility measures, created by integrating cheatgrass percent cover and temporal standard deviation datasets, show that potential increases in future cheatgrass cover match future projections. This discovery indicates that some greater sage grouse PACs for conservation could be at heightened risk of fire disturbance. Multiple factors will affect future cheatgrass cover including changes in precipitation timing and totals and increases in freeze-thaw cycles. Understanding these effects can help direct land management, guide scientific research, and influence policy.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70174930</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huang, Shengli</author><author>Liu, Heping</author><author>Dahal, Devendra</author><author>Jin, Suming</author><author>Li, Shuang</author><author>Liu, Shuguang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spatial variations in immediate greenhouse gases and aerosol emissions and resulting radiative forcing from wildfires in interior Alaska</title><secondary-title>Theoretical and Applied Climatology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Theoretical and Applied Climatology</full-title></periodical><pages>581-592</pages><volume>123</volume><issue>3-4</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00704-015-1379-0</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Boreal fires can cool the climate; however, this conclusion came from individual fires and may not represent the whole story. We hypothesize that the climatic impact of boreal fires depends on local landscape heterogeneity such as burn severity, prefire vegetation type, and soil properties. To test this hypothesis, spatially explicit emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols and their resulting radiative forcing are required as an important and necessary component towards a full assessment. In this study, we integrated remote sensing (Landsat and MODIS) and models (carbon consumption model, emission factors model, and radiative forcing model) to calculate the carbon consumption, GHGs and aerosol emissions, and their radiative forcing of 2001–2010 fires at 30 m resolution in the Yukon River Basin of Alaska. Total carbon consumption showed significant spatial variation, with a mean of 2,615 g C m−2 and a standard deviation of 2,589 g C m−2. The carbon consumption led to different amounts of GHGs and aerosol emissions, ranging from 593.26 Tg (CO2) to 0.16 Tg (N2O). When converted to equivalent CO2 based on global warming potential metric, the maximum 20 years equivalent CO2 was black carbon (713.77 Tg), and the lowest 20 years equivalent CO2 was organic carbon (−583.13 Tg). The resulting radiative forcing also showed significant spatial variation: CO2, CH4, and N2O can cause a 20-year mean radiative forcing of 7.41 W m−2 with a standard deviation of 2.87 W m−2. This emission forcing heterogeneity indicates that different boreal fires have different climatic impacts. When considering the spatial variation of other forcings, such as surface shortwave forcing, we may conclude that some boreal fires, especially boreal deciduous fires, can warm the climate. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Wien.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70117462</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Anderson, Lysanna</author><author>Wahl, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Two Holocene paleofire records from Peten, Guatemala: Implications for natural fire regime and prehispanic Maya land use</title><secondary-title>Global and Planetary Change</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global and Planetary Change</full-title></periodical><pages>82-92</pages><volume>138</volume><keywords><keyword>Charcoal</keyword><keyword>Human impacts</keyword><keyword>Biomass burning</keyword><keyword>Maya lowlands</keyword><keyword>Prehistoric Maya land use</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0921-8181</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.gloplacha.2015.09.012</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Although fire was arguably the primary tool used by the Maya to alter the landscape and extract resources, little attention has been paid to biomass burning in paleoenvironmental reconstructions from the Maya lowlands. Here we report two new well-dated, high-resolution records of biomass burning based on analysis of macroscopic fossil charcoal recovered from lacustrine sediment cores. The records extend from the early Holocene, through the full arc of Maya prehistory, the Colonial, and post-Colonial periods (~ 9000 cal yr BP to the present). (Hereafter BP) The study sites, Lago Paixban and Lago Puerto Arturo, are located in northern Peten, Guatemala. Results provide the first quantitative analysis from the region demonstrating that frequent fires have occurred in the closed canopy forests since at least the early Holocene (~ 9000 BP), prior to occupation by sedentary agriculturalists. Following the arrival of agriculture around 4600 BP, the system transitioned from climate controlled to anthropogenic control. During the Maya period, changes in fire regime are muted and do not appear to be driven by changes in climate conditions. Low charcoal influx and fire frequency in the Earliest Preclassic period suggest that land use strategies may have included intensive agriculture much earlier than previously thought. Preliminary results showing concentrations of soot/black-carbon during the middle and late Preclassic periods are lower than modern background values, providing intriguing implications regarding the efficiency of Maya fuel consumption.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70157212</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hawbaker, Todd J.</author><author>Reddy, Ashwan D.</author><author>Zhu, Zhiliang</author><author>Wurster, Fredric C.</author><author>Duberstein, Jamie A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantifying above and belowground carbon loss following wildfire in peatlands using repeated lidar measurements</title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the 15th International PEAT Congress</full-title></periodical><pages>676-680</pages><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.peatsociety.org/document/quantifying-above-and-belowground-carbon-loss-following-wildfire-peatlands-using-repeated</url></web-urls></urls><custom3>Proceedings of the 15th International PEAT Congress</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Caggiano, Michael D.</author><author>Tinkham, Wade T.</author><author>Hoffman, Chad</author><author>Cheng, Antony S.</author><author>Hawbaker, Todd J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>High resolution mapping of development in the wildland-urban interface using object based image extraction</title><secondary-title>Heliyon</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Heliyon</full-title></periodical><pages>e00174-e00174</pages><volume>2</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Environmental science</keyword><keyword>Geography</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>October 2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.heliyon.2016.e00174</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The wildland-urban interface (WUI), the area where human development encroaches on undeveloped land, is expanding throughout the western United States resulting in increased wildfire risk to homes and communities. Although census based mapping efforts have provided insights into the pattern of development and expansion of the WUI at regional and national scales, these approaches do not provide sufficient detail for fine-scale fire and emergency management planning, which requires maps of individual building locations. Although fine-scale maps of the WUI have been developed, they are often limited in their spatial extent, have unknown accuracies and biases, and are costly to update over time. In this paper we assess a semi-automated Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) approach that utilizes 4-band multispectral National Aerial Image Program (NAIP) imagery for the detection of individual buildings within the WUI. We evaluate this approach by comparing the accuracy and overall quality of extracted buildings to a building footprint control dataset. In addition, we assessed the effects of buffer distance, topographic conditions, and building characteristics on the accuracy and quality of building extraction. The overall accuracy and quality of our approach was positively related to buffer distance, with accuracies ranging from 50 to 95% for buffer distances from 0 to 100 m. Our results also indicate that building detection was sensitive to building size, with smaller outbuildings (footprints less than 75 m2) having detection rates below 80% and larger residential buildings having detection rates above 90%. These findings demonstrate that this approach can successfully identify buildings in the WUI in diverse landscapes while achieving high accuracies at buffer distances appropriate for most fire management applications while overcoming cost and time constraints associated with traditional approaches. This study is unique in that it evaluates the ability of an OBIA approach to extract highly detailed data on building locations in a WUI setting.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S240584401630295X</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Allen, Craig D.</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Sample, V.A.</author><author>Bixler, R.P.</author><author>Miller, C.</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Forest Ecosystem Reorganization Underway in the Southwestern US: A Preview of Widespread Forest Changes in the Anthropocene?</title><secondary-title>Forest Conservation and Management in the Anthropocene: Adaptation of Science, Policy and Practices.</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forest Conservation and Management in the Anthropocene: Adaptation of Science, Policy and Practices.</full-title></periodical><pages>103-122</pages><keywords><keyword>icle</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Boulder</pub-location><isbn>978-85-7811-079-6</isbn><abstract>Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.fort.usgs.gov/sb-pub/forest-ecosystem-reorganization-underway-southwestern-us-preview-widespread-forest-changes</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liang, Lu</author><author>Hawbaker, Todd J.</author><author>Zhu, Zhiliang</author><author>Li, Xuecao</author><author>Gong, Peng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Forest disturbance interactions and successional pathways in the Southern Rocky Mountains</title><secondary-title>Forest Ecology and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forest Ecology and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>35-45</pages><volume>375</volume><keywords><keyword>Disturbance</keyword><keyword>Recovery</keyword><keyword>Fire</keyword><keyword>Landsat</keyword><keyword>Mountain pine beetle</keyword><keyword>Time series</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>September 2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0378-1127</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.foreco.2016.05.010</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The pine forests in the southern portion of the Rocky Mountains are a heterogeneous mosaic of disturbance and recovery. The most extensive and intensive stress and mortality are received from human activity, fire, and mountain pine beetles (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae). Understanding disturbance interactions and disturbance-succession pathways are crucial for adapting management strategies to mitigate their impacts and anticipate future ecosystem change. Driven by this goal, we assessed the forest disturbance and recovery history in the Southern Rocky Mountains Ecoregion using a 13-year time series of Landsat image stacks. An automated classification workflow that integrates temporal segmentation techniques and a random forest classifier was used to examine disturbance patterns. To enhance efficiency in selecting representative samples at the ecoregion scale, a new sampling strategy that takes advantage of the scene-overlap among adjacent Landsat images was designed. The segment-based assessment revealed that the overall accuracy for all 14 scenes varied from 73.6% to 92.5%, with a mean of 83.1%. A design-based inference indicated the average producer's and user's accuracies for MPB mortality were 85.4% and 82.5% respectively. We found that burn severity was largely unrelated to the severity of pre-fire beetle outbreaks in this region, where the severity of post-fire beetle outbreaks generally decreased in relation to burn severity. Approximately half the clear-cut and burned areas were in various stages of recovery, but the regeneration rate was much slower for MPB-disturbed sites. Pre-fire beetle outbreaks and subsequent fire produced positive compound effects on seedling reestablishment in this ecoregion. Taken together, these results emphasize that although multiple disturbances do play a role in the resilience mechanism of the serotinous lodgepole pine, the overall recovery could be slow due to the vast area of beetle mortality.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378112716302377</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Johnstone, Jill F.</author><author>Allen, Craig D.</author><author>Franklin, Jerry F.</author><author>Frelich, Lee E.</author><author>Harvey, Brian J.</author><author>Higuera, Philip E.</author><author>Mack, Michelle C.</author><author>Meentemeyer, Ross K.</author><author>Metz, Margaret R.</author><author>Perry, George L.W.</author><author>Schoennagel, Tania</author><author>Turner, Monica G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Changing disturbance regimes, ecological memory, and forest resilience</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment</full-title></periodical><pages>369-378</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>7</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>September 2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>9788578110796</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/fee.1311</electronic-resource-num><abstract>applicability for this approach.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/fee.1311</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Clark, James S.</author><author>Iverson, Louis</author><author>Woodall, Christopher W.</author><author>Allen, Craig D.</author><author>Bell, David M.</author><author>Bragg, Don C.</author><author>D'Amato, Anthony W.</author><author>Davis, Frank W.</author><author>Hersh, Michelle H.</author><author>Ibanez, Ines</author><author>Jackson, Stephen T.</author><author>Matthews, Stephen</author><author>Pederson, Neil</author><author>Peters, Matthew</author><author>Schwartz, Mark W.</author><author>Waring, Kristen M.</author><author>Zimmermann, Niklaus E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The impacts of increasing drought on forest dynamics, structure, and biodiversity in the United States</title><secondary-title>Global change biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global change biology</full-title></periodical><pages>2329-2352</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>climate change</keyword><keyword>drought</keyword><keyword>forest dieback</keyword><keyword>forest management</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>July 2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1365-2486 (Electronic)\r1354-1013 (Linking)</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/gcb.13160</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We synthesize insights from current understanding of drought impacts at stand-to-biogeographic scales, including management options, and we identify challenges to be addressed with new research. Large stand-level shifts underway in western forests already are showing the importance of interactions involving drought, insects, and fire. Diebacks, changes in composition and structure, and shifting range limits are widely observed. In the eastern US, the effects of increasing drought are becoming better understood at the level of individual trees, but this knowledge cannot yet be confidently translated to predictions of changing structure and diversity of forest stands. While eastern forests have not experienced the types of changes seen in western forests in recent decades, they too are vulnerable to drought and could experience significant changes with increased severity, frequency, or duration in drought. Throughout the continental United States, the combination of projected large climate-induced shifts in suitable habitat from modeling studies and limited potential for the rapid migration of tree populations suggests that changing tree and forest biogeography could substantially lag habitat shifts already underway. Forest management practices can partially ameliorate drought impacts through reductions in stand density, selection of drought-tolerant species and genotypes, artificial regeneration, and the development of multistructured stands. However, silvicultural treatments also could exacerbate drought impacts unless implemented with careful attention to site and stand characteristics. Gaps in our understanding should motivate new research on the effects of interactions involving climate and other species at the stand scale and how interactions and multiple responses are represented in models. This assessment indicates that, without a stronger empirical basis for drought impacts at the stand scale, more complex models may provide limited guidance.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/gcb.13160</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hantson, Stijn</author><author>Kloster, Silvia</author><author>Coughlan, Michael</author><author>Daniau, Anne Laure</author><author>Vannière, Boris</author><author>Brücher, Tim</author><author>Kehrwald, Natalie</author><author>Magi, Brian I.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fire in the earth system: Bridging data and modeling research</title><secondary-title>Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society</full-title></periodical><pages>1069-1072</pages><volume>97</volume><issue>6</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>June 2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>10.1175/BAMS-D-15-00319.1</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/BAMS-D-15-00319.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>©2016 American Meteorological Society. Modeling and databased methods to study fire have rapidly coevolved over the past decade. Currently, however, very few initiatives link these important data types. The goal during the recent paleofire-themed workshop was to outline methods to link paleofire datasets with fire modeling to increase our understanding of variability in the global fire regime. The workshop facilitated advances in efforts to calibrate relative trends of biomass burning determined from charcoal accumulated in sediments to physical fire metrics, such as burned area or fuel consumption. Our discussions advanced linking data and modeling to study interactions between climate, ecology, humans, and fire, with a focus on the effect of humans on biomass burning at regional to global scales. This workshop highlighted how interdisciplinary discussions among scientists can initiate advances that disciplinary research in fire science cannot accomplish.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/BAMS-D-15-00319.1</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kehrwald, Natalie</author><author>Aleman, Julie</author><author>Coughlan, Michael</author><author>Courtney-Mustalphi, Colin</author><author>Githumbi, Esther</author><author>Magi, Brian I.</author><author>Marlon, Jennifer R.</author><author>Power, Mitchell J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>One thousand years of fires: Integrating proxy and model data</title><secondary-title>Frontiers of Biogeography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers of Biogeography</full-title></periodical><pages>e29606-e29606</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>9780980200454</isbn><abstract>The current fires raging across Indonesia are emitting more carbon than the annual fossil fuel emissions of Germany or Japan, and the fires are still consuming vast tracts of rainforest and peatlands. The National Interagency Fire Center (www.nifc.gov) notes that 2015 is one worst fire years on record in the U.S., where more than 9 million acres burned -- equivalent to the combined size of Massachusetts and New Jersey. The U.S. and Indonesian fires have already displaced tens of thousands of people, and their impacts on ecosystems are still unclear. In the case of Indonesia, the burning peat is destroying much of the existing soil, with unknown implications for the type of vegetation regrowth. Such large fires result from a combination of fire management practices, increasing anthropogenic land use, and a changing climate. The expected increase in fire activity in the upcoming decades has led to a surge in research trying to understand their causes, the factors that may have influenced similar times of fire activity in the past, and the implications of such fire activity in the future. Multiple types of complementary data provide information on the impacts of current fires and the extent of past fires. The wide array of data encompasses different spatial and temporal resolutions (Figure 1) and includes fire proxy information such as charcoal and tree ring fire scars, observational records, satellite products, modern emissions data, fire models within global land cover and vegetation models, and sociodemographic data for modeling past human land use and ignition frequency. Any single data type is more powerful when combined with another source of information. Merging model and proxy data enables analyses of how fire activity modifies vegetation distribution, air and water quality, and proximity to cities; these analyses in turn support land management decisions relating to conservation and development.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1d92610x</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lutz, James A</author><author>Matchett, John R</author><author>Tarnay, Leland W</author><author>Smith, Douglas F</author><author>Becker, Kendall M L</author><author>Furniss, Tucker J</author><author>Brooks, Matthew L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fire and the distribution and uncertainty of carbon sequestered as above-ground tree biomass in Yosemite and Sequoia &amp; Kings Canyon National Parks</title><secondary-title>Land</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Land</full-title></periodical><volume>6</volume><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/land6010010</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70182056</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Haas, Jessica R</author><author>Thompson, Matthew P</author><author>Tillery, Anne C</author><author>Scott, Joe H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Capturing spatiotemporal variation in wildfires for improving postwildfire debris-flow hazard assessments: Chapter 20</title><secondary-title>Natural Hazard Uncertainty Assessment: Modeling and Decision Support</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Natural Hazard Uncertainty Assessment: Modeling and Decision Support</full-title></periodical><pages>301-317</pages><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Washington, D.C.</pub-location><publisher>American Geophysical Union</publisher><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70164381</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hawthorne, Donna</author><author>Mustaphi, Colin J Courtney</author><author>Aleman, Julie C</author><author>Blarquez, Olivier</author><author>Colombaroli, Daniele</author><author>Daniau, Anne-Laure</author><author>Marlon, Jennifer R</author><author>Power, Mitchell</author><author>Vannière, Boris</author><author>Han, Yongming</author><author>Hantson, Stijn</author><author>Kehrwald, Natalie</author><author>Magi, Brian</author><author>Yue, Xu</author><author>Carcaillet, Christopher</author><author>Marchant, Rob</author><author>Ogunkoya, Ayodele</author><author>Githumbi, Esther N</author><author>Muriuki, Rebecca M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Global Modern Charcoal Dataset (GMCD): A tool for exploring proxy-fire linkages and spatial patterns of biomass burning</title><secondary-title>Quaternary International</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Quaternary International</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Vegetation</keyword><keyword>Calibration</keyword><keyword>Biomass burning</keyword><keyword>Dataset</keyword><keyword>Standardized methodologies</keyword><keyword>Surface sample</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.quaint.2017.03.046</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Abstract Progresses in reconstructing Earth's history of biomass burning has motivated the development of a modern charcoal dataset covering the last decades through a community-based initiative called the Global Modern Charcoal Dataset (GMCD). As the frequency, intensity and spatial scale of fires are predicted to increase regionally and globally in conjunction with changing climate, anthropogenic activities and land-use patterns, there is an increasing need to further understand, calibrate and interrogate recent and past fire regimes as related to changing fire emissions and changing carbon sources and sinks. Discussions at the PAGES Global Paleofire Working Group workshop 2015, including paleoecologists, numerical modelers, statisticians, paleoclimatologists, archeologists, and anthropologists, identified an urgent need for an open, standardized, quality-controlled and globally representative dataset of modern sedimentary charcoal and other sediment-based fire proxies. This dataset fits into a gap between metrics of biomass burning indicators, current fire regimes and land cover, and carbon emissions inventories. The dataset will enable the calibration of paleofire data with other modern datasets including: data of satellite derived fire occurrence, vegetation patterns and species diversity, land cover change, and a range of sources capturing biochemical cycling. Standardized protocols are presented for collecting and analyzing sediment-based fire proxies, including charcoal, levoglucosan, black carbon, and soot. The GMCD will provide a publically-accessible repository of modern fire sediment surface samples in all terrestrial ecosystems. Sample collection and contributions to the dataset will be solicited from lacustrine, peat, marine, glacial, or other sediments, from a wide variety of ecosystems and geographic locations.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S104061821630831X</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hossack, Blake R</author><author>Honeycutt, Richard</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Declines revisited: Long-term recovery and spatial population dynamics oftailed frog larvae after wildfire</title><secondary-title>Biological Conservation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biological Conservation</full-title></periodical><pages>274-278</pages><volume>212</volume><issue>A</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.biocon.2017.06.022</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70192261</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chambers, Jeanne C</author><author>Beck, Jeffrey L</author><author>Bradford, John B</author><author>Bybee, Jared</author><author>Campbell, Steve</author><author>Carlson, John</author><author>Christiansen, Thomas J</author><author>Clause, Karen J</author><author>Collins, Gail</author><author>Crist, Michele R</author><author>Dinkins, Jonathan B</author><author>Doherty, Kevin E</author><author>Edwards, Fred</author><author>Espinosa, Shawn</author><author>Griffin, Kathleen A</author><author>Griffin, Paul</author><author>Haas, Jessica R</author><author>Hanser, Steve</author><author>Havlina, Douglas W</author><author>Henke, Kenneth F</author><author>Hennig, Jacob D</author><author>Joyce, Linda A</author><author>Kilkenny, Francis F</author><author>Kulpa, Sarah M</author><author>Kurth, Laurie L</author><author>Maestas, Jeremy D</author><author>Manning, Mary</author><author>Mayer, Kenneth E</author><author>Mealor, Brian A</author><author>McCarthy, Clinton</author><author>Pellant, Mike</author><author>Perea, Marco A</author><author>Prentice, Karen L</author><author>Pyke, David A</author><author>Wiechman, Lief A</author><author>Wuenschel, Amarina</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Science framework for conservation and restoration of the sagebrush biome: Linking the Department of the Interior’s Integrated Rangeland Fire Management Strategy to long-term strategic conservation actions, Part 1.

One challenge of applying sediment charcoal records to infer fire history is the separation of charcoal associated with local fire occurrence and charcoal originating from regional fire activity. Despite a variety of methods to identify local fires from sediment charcoal records, an integrated statistical framework for fire reconstruction is lacking. We develop a Bayesian point process model to estimate probability of fire associated with charcoal counts from individual-lake sediments and estimate mean fire return intervals. A multivariate extension of the model combines records from multiple lakes to reduce uncertainty in local fire identification and estimate a regional mean fire return interval. The univariate and multivariate models are applied to 13 lakes in the Yukon Flats region of Alaska. Both models resulted in similar mean fire return intervals (100-350 years) with reduced uncertainty under the multivariate model due to improved estimation of regional charcoal deposition. The point process model offers an integrated statistical framework for paleo-fire reconstruction and extends existing methods to infer regional fire history from multiple lake records with uncertainty following directly from posterior distributions.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70192628</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McCarley, T.

While these agents of forest change frequently overlap, uncertainty remains regarding their interactions and influence on specific subsequent fire effects such as change in canopy cover. Acquisition of pre- and post-fire Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data on the 2012 Pole Creek Fire in central Oregon provided an opportunity to isolate and quantify fire effects coincident with specific agents of change. This study characterizes the influence of pre-fire mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae) and timber harvest disturbances on LiDAR-estimated change in canopy cover. Observed canopy loss from fire was greater (higher severity) in areas experiencing pre-fire MPB (Δ 18.8%CC) than fire-only (Δ 11.1%CC). Additionally, increasing MPB intensity was directly related to greater canopy loss. Canopy loss was lower for all areas of pre-fire timber harvest (Δ 3.9%CC) than for fire-only, but among harvested areas, the greatest change was observed in the oldest treatments and the most intensive treatments [i.e., stand clearcut (Δ 5.0%CC) and combination of shelterwood establishment cuts and shelterwood removal cuts (Δ 7.7%CC)]. These results highlight the importance of accounting for and understanding the impact of pre-fire agents of change such as MPB and timber harvest on subsequent fire effects in land management planning. This work also demonstrates the utility of multi-temporal LiDAR as a tool for quantifying these landscape-scale interactions.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70191301</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wonkka, Carissa L.</author><author>Twidwell, Dirac</author><author>Bielski, Christine H.</author><author>Allen, Craig R.</author><author>Stambaugh, Michael C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Regeneration and invasion of cottonwood riparian forest following wildfire</title><secondary-title>Restoration Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Restoration Ecology</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Resprouting</keyword><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Tamarisk</keyword><keyword>Cimarron River</keyword><keyword>Populus deltoides</keyword><keyword>Riparian forest regeneration</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>September 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/rec.12577</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Populus deltoides is considered to be a weak resprouter and highly susceptible to wildfire, but few post-wildfire studies have tracked P. deltoides response and resprouting within the Great Plains of North America. Following a wildfire in southwestern Kansas, U.S.A., we surveyed burned and unburned areas of a cottonwood riparian forest along the Cimarron River that included a major understory invader, tamarisk (Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb.). We tested the following hypotheses, which are consistent with the current understanding of P. deltoides response to wildfire in the Great Plains: (1) regeneration of P. deltoides will be low in areas burned by the wildfire; (2) the number of dead P. deltoides individuals will be greater in the wildfire than unburned areas; and (3) tamarisk regeneration will be higher than P. deltoides regeneration in the wildfire areas because tamarisk is considered a stronger resprouter. We found evidence contrary to two of our hypotheses 3 years following the wildfire. (1) P. deltoides regeneration was high following the wildfire, averaging 692 individuals/ha. (2) The number of dead mature cottonwood trees was greater in wildfire plots than in unburned plots. (3) There was more P. deltoides regeneration than tamarisk regeneration following wildfire. These findings, which diverge from themajority of studies examining P. deltoides regeneration in theGreat Plains, suggest that differing local environmental and forest stand conditions, coupled with the timing and intensity of the fire, could be important determinants of riparian forest species’ responses to wildfire.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70192049</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>West, Amanda M.</author><author>Evangelista, Paul H.</author><author>Jarnevich, Catherine S.</author><author>Kumar, Sunil</author><author>Swallow, Aaron</author><author>Luizza, Matthew W.</author><author>Chignell, Stephen M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using multi-date satellite imagery to monitor invasive grass species distribution in post-wildfire landscapes: An iterative, adaptable approach that employs open-source data and software</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation</full-title></periodical><pages>135-146</pages><volume>59</volume><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>July 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jag.2017.03.009</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Among the most pressing concerns of land managers in post-wildfire landscapes are the establishment and spread of invasive species. Land managers need accurate maps of invasive species cover for targeted management post-disturbance that are easily transferable across space and time. In this study, we sought to develop an iterative, replicable methodology based on limited invasive species occurrence data, freely available remotely sensed data, and open source software to predict the distribution of Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) in a post-wildfire landscape. We developed four species distribution models using eight spectral indices derived from five months of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data in 2014. These months corresponded to both cheatgrass growing period and time of field data collection in the study area. The four models were improved using an iterative approach in which a threshold for cover was established, and all models had high sensitivity values when tested on an independent dataset. We also quantified the area at highest risk for invasion in future seasons given 2014 distribution, topographic covariates, and seed dispersal limitations. These models demonstrate the effectiveness of using derived multi-date spectral indices as proxies for species occurrence on the landscape, the importance of selecting thresholds for invasive species cover to evaluate ecological risk in species distribution models, and the applicability of Landsat 8 OLI and the Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling for targeted invasive species management.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0303243417300727</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Guangsheng</author><author>Hayes, Daniel J.</author><author>David McGuire, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Contributions of wildland fire to terrestrial ecosystem carbon dynamics in North America from 1990 to 2012</title><secondary-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Biogeochemical Cycles</full-title></periodical><pages>878-900</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>direct carbon emission</keyword><keyword>fire disturbance</keyword><keyword>legacy effect</keyword><keyword>net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB)</keyword><keyword>vegetation regrowth</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>May 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2016GB005548</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Burn area and the frequency of extreme fire events have been increasing&#xD;during recent decades in North America, and this trend is expected to&#xD;continue over the 21st century. While many aspects of the North American&#xD;carbon budget have been intensively studied, the net contribution of&#xD;fire disturbance to the overall net carbon flux at the continental scale&#xD;remains uncertain. Based on national scale, spatially explicit and&#xD;long-term fire data, along with the improved model parameterization in a&#xD;process-based ecosystem model, we simulated the impact of fire&#xD;disturbance on both direct carbon emissions and net terrestrial&#xD;ecosystem carbon balance in North America. Fire-caused direct carbon&#xD;emissions were 106.55 +/- 15.98 Tg C/yr during 1990-2012; however, the&#xD;net ecosystem carbon balance associated with fire was -26.09 +/- 5.22 Tg&#xD;C/yr, indicating that most of the emitted carbon was resequestered by&#xD;the terrestrial ecosystem. Direct carbon emissions showed an increase in&#xD;Alaska and Canada during 1990-2012 as compared to prior periods due to&#xD;more extreme fire events, resulting in a large carbon source from these&#xD;two regions. Among biomes, the largest carbon source was found to be&#xD;from the boreal forest, primarily due to large reductions in soil&#xD;organic matter during, and with slower recovery after, fire events. The&#xD;interactions between fire and environmental factors reduced the&#xD;fire-caused ecosystem carbon source. Fire disturbance only caused a weak&#xD;carbon source as compared to the best estimate terrestrial carbon sink&#xD;in North America owing to the long-term legacy effects of historical&#xD;burn area coupled with fast ecosystem recovery during 1990-2012.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70192739</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ebel, Brian A.</author><author>Moody, John A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Synthesis of soil-hydraulic properties and infiltration timescales in wildfire-affected soils</title><secondary-title>Hydrological Processes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hydrological Processes</full-title></periodical><pages>324-340</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>wildfire</keyword><keyword>Green-Ampt</keyword><keyword>runoff</keyword><keyword>runoff generation</keyword><keyword>saturated hydraulic conductivity</keyword><keyword>sorptivity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>January 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1099-1085</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/hyp.10998</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70179740</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Clark, Jason A.</author><author>Loehman, Rachel A.</author><author>Keane, Robert E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Climate changes and wildfire alter vegetation of Yellowstone National Park, but forest cover persists</title><secondary-title>Ecosphere</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecosphere</full-title></periodical><pages>e01636-e01636</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Fire regime</keyword><keyword>Forest dynamics</keyword><keyword>Douglas-fir</keyword><keyword>Pinus contorta</keyword><keyword>Yellowstone National Park</keyword><keyword>Lodgepole pine</keyword><keyword>FireBGCv2</keyword><keyword>Landscape simulation model</keyword><keyword>Pseudotsuga menziesii</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>January 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/ecs2.1636</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We present landscape simulation results contrasting effects of changing climates on forest vegetation and fire regimes in Yellowstone National Park, USA, by mid-21st century. We simulated potential changes to fire dynamics and forest characteristics under three future climate projections representing a range of potential future conditions using the FireBGCv2 model. Under the future climate scenarios with moderate warming ({&gt;}2°C) and moderate increases in precipitation (3–5%), model simulations resulted in 1.2–4.2 times more burned area, decreases in forest cover (10–44%), and reductions in basal area (14–60%). In these same scenarios, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) decreased in basal area (18–41%), while Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) basal area increased (21–58%). Conversely, mild warming ({&lt;}2°C) coupled with greater increases in precipitation (12–13%) suggested an increase in forest cover and basal area by mid-century, with spruce and subalpine fir increasing in abundance. Overall, we found changes in forest tree species compositions were caused by the climate-mediated changes in fire regime (56–315% increase in annual area burned). Simulated changes in forest composition and fire regime under warming climates portray a landscape that shifts from lodgepole pine to Douglas-fir caused by the interaction between the magnitude and seasonality of future climate changes, by climate-induced changes in the frequency and intensity of wildfires, and by tree species response.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70194309</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pausas, Juli G.</author><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epicormic Resprouting in Fire-Prone Ecosystems</title><secondary-title>Trends in Plant Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Trends in Plant Science</full-title></periodical><pages>1008-1015</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>disturbance</keyword><keyword>epicormic resprouting</keyword><keyword>evolutionary fire ecology</keyword><keyword>regenerations</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>December 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tplants.2017.08.010</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Many plants resprout from basal buds after disturbance, and this is common in shrublands subjected to high-intensity fires. However, resprouting after fire from epicormic (stem) buds is globally far less common. Unlike basal resprouting, post-fire epicormic resprouting is a key plant adaptation for retention of the arborescent skeleton after fire, allowing rapid recovery of the forest or woodland and leading to greater ecosystem resilience under recurrent high-intensity fires. Here we review the biogeography of epicormic resprouting, the mechanisms of protection, the fire regimes where it occurs, and the evolutionary drivers that shaped this trait. We propose that epicormic resprouting is adaptive in ecosystems with high fire frequency and relatively high productivity, at moderate–high fire intensities. Whether a tree resprouts from the base or from stem (epicormic) buds has strong implications for forest structure and carbon balance in post-fire conditions. Epicormic resprouting is a key plant trait that allows quick regeneration of the tree and of ecosystem functioning. Epicormic resprouting is especially adaptive in ecosystems with high fire frequency and relatively high productivity, at moderate–high fire intensities. Epicormic resprouters are the trees most resilient to high-intensity crown fires.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70191878</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Roberts, Anthony J</author><author>Boal, Clint W</author><author>Whitlaw, Heather A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nesting ecology of grassland birds following a wildfire in the southern Great Plains</title><secondary-title>The Southwestern Naturalist</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Southwestern Naturalist</full-title></periodical><pages>39-45</pages><volume>62</volume><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>March 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1894/0038-4909-62.1.39</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.bioone.org/doi/10.1894/0038-4909-62.1.39</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>D'Antonio, Carla M.</author><author>Yelenik, Stephanie G.</author><author>Mack, Michelle C.</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Flory, Luke</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Ecosystem vs. community recovery 25 years after grass invasions and fire in a subtropical woodland</title><secondary-title>Journal of Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>1462-1474</pages><volume>105</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>disturbance</keyword><keyword>resilience</keyword><keyword>alternative states</keyword><keyword>ANPP</keyword><keyword>ecosystem processes</keyword><keyword>exotic species</keyword><keyword>long-term impacts</keyword><keyword>net primary productivity</keyword><keyword>secondary invasions</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>November 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/1365-2745.12855</electronic-resource-num><abstract>1. Despite a large body of research documenting invasive plant impacts,&#xD;few studies have followed individual invaded sites over decades to&#xD;observe how they change, and none have contrasted how compositional&#xD;impacts from invasion compare to ecosystem-process impacts over a&#xD;multi-decadal time-scale.&#xD;2. Using direct measurements of plant density and composition and of&#xD;ecosystems processes, we evaluate how ecosystem structure, above-ground&#xD;net primary production (ANPP), and above-ground and soil nutrient pools&#xD;compare over 25 years since fire and C4 grass invasions disrupted&#xD;seasonally dry Hawaiian woodlands. We compare structure and function&#xD;between primary woodland that has never burned and is largely native&#xD;species-dominated, with sites that had been the same woodland type but&#xD;burned in alien-grass-fuelled fires in the 1970s and 1980s. The sites&#xD;have not experienced fires since 1987.&#xD;3. We report here that woody plant composition and structure continue to&#xD;be dramatically changed by the initial invasions and fires that occurred&#xD;25 years ago and invaders continue to dominate in burned sites. This is&#xD;reflected in continued low plant carbon pools in burned compared to&#xD;unburned sites. Yet ANPP and N storage, which were dramatically lower in&#xD;the initial decade after invasive-grass fuelled fires, have increased&#xD;and are now indistinguishable from values measured in intact woodlands.&#xD;Soil carbon pools were resilient to both invasion and fire initially and&#xD;over time.&#xD;4. Above-ground net primary production has recovered because of invasion&#xD;of burned sites by a non-native N-fixing tree rather than because of&#xD;recovery of native species. This invasive N-fixing tree is unlikely to&#xD;return C storage of the invaded sites to those of unburned woodland&#xD;because of its tissue and growth characteristics and its interactions&#xD;with invasive grasses. It does not facilitate native species but rather&#xD;promotes a persistent invasive grass/N-fixer savanna.&#xD;5. Synthesis. We conclude that fire, an unusual disturbance in this&#xD;system, has perpetuated the dominance of these sites by invasive species&#xD;and that despite the dramatic recovery of above-ground net primary&#xD;production and N pools, the ecosystem continues to be in a distinctly&#xD;different state than the pre-fire, pre-Melinis community. Thus, despite&#xD;the absence of further disturbance (fire), there is no evidence that&#xD;succession towards the original ecosystem is occurring. The fact that N&#xD;pools and above-ground net primary production recover because of a new&#xD;invader (Morella faya), highlights the unpredictability of ecosystem&#xD;trajectories in the face of altered regional species pools.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70192256</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McCullough, Kelsey</author><author>Albanese, Gene</author><author>Haukos, David A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Novel Observations of Larval Fire Survival, Feeding Behavior, and Host Plant Use in the Regal Fritillary, Speyeria idalia (Drury) (Nymphalidae)</title><secondary-title>Journal of the Lepidopterists' Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the Lepidopterists' Society</full-title></periodical><pages>146-152</pages><volume>71</volume><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>September 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.18473/lepi.71i3.a4</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.bioone.org/doi/10.18473/lepi.71i3.a4</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aanderud, Zachary T.</author><author>Schoolmaster, Donald R.</author><author>Rigby, Deborah</author><author>Bybee, Jordon</author><author>Campbell, Tayte</author><author>Roundy, Bruce A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Soils mediate the impact of fine woody debris on invasive and native grasses as whole trees are mechanically shredded into firebreaks in piñon-juniper woodlands</title><secondary-title>Journal of Arid Environments</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Arid Environments</full-title></periodical><pages>60-68</pages><volume>137</volume><keywords><keyword>Bromus tectorum</keyword><keyword>Mastication</keyword><keyword>Microbial biomass</keyword><keyword>Phosphorus</keyword><keyword>Pseudoroegneria spicata</keyword><keyword>Shredding</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>February 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jaridenv.2016.11.002</electronic-resource-num><abstract>To stem wildfires, trees are being mechanically shredded into firebreaks with the resulting fine woody debris (FWD) potentially exerting immense control over soil and plants. We linked FWD-induced changes in microbial activity and nutrient availability to the frequency of Bromus tectorum and three native, perennial grasses across 31 piñon-juniper woodlands, UT, USA. Using a series of mixed models, we found that FWD increased the frequency of three of the four grasses by at least 12%. Deep, as opposed to shallow, soils mediated frequencies following FWD additions but only partially explained the variation in Bromus and Pseudoroegneria spicata. Although fertile areas associated with tree-islands elicited no response, FWD-induced increases in nitrogen mineralization in deep soils (15–17 cm) caused the frequency of the exotic and Pseudoroegneria to rise. Higher phosphorus availability in FWD-covered surface soils (0–2 cm) had no impact on grasses. FWD altered deep soil respiration, and deep and shallow microbial biomass structuring Pseudoroegneria frequencies, suggesting that microorganism themselves regulated Pseudoroegneria. The positive effects of FWD on grass frequencies intensified over time for natives but diminished for Bromus. Our results demonstrate that microorganisms in deeper soils helped mediate species-specific responses to disturbance both facilitating exotic invasion and promoting native establishment.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70178480</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gigliotti, Laura C.</author><author>Jones, Benjamin C.</author><author>Lovallo, Matthew J.</author><author>Diefenbach, Duane R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Snowshoe hare multi-level habitat use in a fire-adapted ecosystem</title><secondary-title>The Journal of Wildlife Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of Wildlife Management</full-title></periodical><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>October 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jwmg.21375</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Prescribed burning has the potential to improve habitat for species that depend on pyric ecosystems or other early successional vegetation types. For species that occupy diverse plant communities over the extent of their range, response to disturbances such as fire might vary based on post-disturbance vegetation dynamics among plant communities. Although responses of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) to fire have been studied in conifer-dominated forests in northern parts of the species' range, there is a lack of information on snowshoe hare habitat use in fire-dependent communities in southern parts of their range. We used global positioning system (GPS) and very high frequency (VHF) radio-collars to monitor the habitat use of 32 snowshoe hares in a scrub-oak (Quercus ilicifolia)-pitch pine (Pinus rigida) barrens complex in northeastern Pennsylvania where prescribed fire has been used for habitat restoration. The area contained stands that underwent prescribed burning 1–6 years prior to our study. Also, we investigated fine-scale determinants of habitat use within stands. We found that regardless of season, hares did not select for areas that had been burned within 6 years prior. Hares primarily used stands of older scrub oak, conifer, or hardwoods, which contained dense understory vegetation and canopy cover. Hare habitat use also was positively associated with stand edges. Our results suggest that hares do not respond to prescribed burning of scrub oak in the short-term. In addition, by focusing on structural determinants of habitat use, rather than broad-scale characteristics such as stand type, management strategies for snowshoe hares can be adapted over the extent of their range despite the multitude of different land cover types across which the species occurs. Historically, fire has been used for habitat management purposes, although prescribed burning is only starting to be widely used again after decades of fire suppression regulations (Ryan et al. 2013, Brose 2014). As managers are beginning to incorporate more prescribed burning into management plans, a better understanding of the effects of fire on wildlife is important. Fires, both natural and prescribed, can positively affect wildlife species by creating early successional habitat and increasing or improving the quality of forage and browse (Brose and Van Lear 1998, Lashley et al. 2011). However, fire also has the potential to negatively affect wildlife by limiting available habitat in the short term (Joly et al. 2003, Fisher and Wilkinson 2005). Prescribed burns often create patchy and diverse vegetation, leading to fine-scale differences in vegetation structure (Larson and Churchill 2012). Different forest types require different burn frequencies and vary in their regeneration rates (Fryer and Luensmann 2012); thus, understanding the responses of wildlife to prescribed burns in different forest types is important. Snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) are found throughout Canada and the northern United States, but the ecology of populations near the southern extent of their range is not well-understood and these populations are more vulnerable to changes in habitat availability and climate (Burt 2014, Diefenbach et al. 2016, Sultaire et al. 2016a). Throughout their range, hares are associated with areas of dense understory vegetation and canopies (Litvaitis et al. 1985, Griffin and Mills 2009, Ivan et al. 2014), but dominant vegetation types differ greatly over the extent of their range, leading to differences in vegetative regeneration patterns following disturbance or management. Therefore, to best manage habitat for snowshoe hares throughout the extent of their range, it is important to develop an understanding of how hares respond to manage-ment of diverse vegetation communities.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/jwmg.21375</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ebel, Brian A.</author><author>Martin, Deborah A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Meta-analysis of field-saturated hydraulic conductivity recovery following wildland fire: Applications for hydrologic model parameterization and resilience assessment</title><secondary-title>Hydrological Processes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hydrological Processes</full-title></periodical><pages>3682-3696</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>21</issue><keywords><keyword>fire</keyword><keyword>recovery</keyword><keyword>wildfire</keyword><keyword>resilience</keyword><keyword>hydraulic conductivity</keyword><keyword>soil hydraulic property</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>October 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/hyp.11288</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Hydrologic recovery after wildfire is critical for restoring the&#xD;ecosystem services of protecting of human lives and infrastructure from&#xD;hazards and delivering water supply of sufficient quality and quantity.&#xD;Recovery of soil-hydraulic properties, such as field-saturated hydraulic&#xD;conductivity (K-fs), is a key factor for assessing the duration of&#xD;watershed-scale flash flood and debris flow risks after wildfire.&#xD;Despite the crucial role of K-fs in parameterizing numerical hydrologic&#xD;models to predict the magnitude of postwildfire run-off and erosion,&#xD;existing quantitative relations to predict K-fs recovery with time since&#xD;wildfire are lacking.

Plant nutrient concentrations and stoichiometry drive fundamental ecosystem processes, with important implications for primary production, diversity, and ecosystem sustainability. While a range of evidence exists regarding how plant nutrients vary across spatial scales, our understanding of their temporal variation remains less well understood. Nevertheless, we know nutrients regulate plant function across time, and that important temporal controls could strongly interact with environmental change. Here, we report results from a 3-year assessment of inter-annual changes of foliar nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations and stoichiometry in three dominant grasses in response to N deposition and prescribed fire in a temperate steppe of northern China. Foliar N and P concentrations and their ratios varied greatly among years, with this temporal variation strongly related to inter-annual variation in precipitation. Nitrogen deposition significantly increased foliar N concentrations and N:P ratios in all species, while fire significantly altered foliar N and P concentrations but had no significant impacts on N:P ratios. Generally, N addition enhanced the temporal stability of foliar N and decreased that of foliar P and of N:P ratios. Our results indicate that plant nutrient status and response to environmen tal change are temporally dynamic and that there are differential effects on the interactions between environmental change drivers and timing for different nutrients. These responses have important implications for consideration of global change effects on plant community structure and function, management strategies, and the modeling of biogeochemical cycles under global change scenarios.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70190747</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kane, Jeffrey M.</author><author>Varner, J.

Here we develop and define terminology, expand on the existing conceptual framework and review the patterns and mechanisms of disturbance interactions with a focus on interactions between fire and other forest disturbances and a specific emphasis on resulting tree mortality. The types of interactions reflect the positive, negative, or neutral responses to the incidence, intensity, and effects of the interaction. These types of interactions are not always mutually exclusive, but can be distinct. The collective effect of the interactions will determine the longer-term ecosystem response that can result in a resistant, resilient, or compounded interaction. Our review indicates that the interactions of drought, bark beetles, or pathogens with fire often result in neutral or maintained interactions that do not negatively or positively influence the incidence or intensity following fire. The effect of these disturbance interactions on tree mortality ranged from antagonistic (reduced mortality compared to individual disturbances) to synergistic (greater mortality compared to individual disturbances) within and among disturbance interaction types but often resulted in additive effects (mortality is consistent with the summation of the two disturbances). Synergistic effects on tree mortality have been observed when the severity of the initial disturbance is moderate to high and time between disturbances is relatively short. When the sequence of disturbance interaction is reversed (e.g., fire precedes other disturbances) the conditions can generally promote impeded interactions (lower incidence of interaction), reduced interactions (lower intensity of interaction), and antagonistic interactions (lower tree mortality). While recent research on fire-disturbance interactions has increased over the last decade and provided important insights, more research that identifies the specific thresholds of incidence, intensity, and effects of interaction by region and forest type are needed to better assist management solutions that promote desired outcomes in rapidly changing ecosystems.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70191901</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moody, John A</author><author>Martin, Deborah A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Description of chronostratigraphic units preserved as channel deposits and geomorphic processes following a basin-scale disturbance by a wildfire in Colorado</title></titles><pages>79-79</pages><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Reston, VA</pub-location><isbn>2017-1090</isbn><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20171090</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McCarley, T.

Predominantly this is accomplished with either multi-spectral remote sensing data or through ground-based field sampling plots. While these methods are important, field data is usually limited to opportunistic post-fire observations, and spectral data often lacks validation with specific variables of change. Additional uncertainty remains regarding how best to account for environmental variables influencing fire effects (e.g., weather) for which observational data cannot easily be acquired, and whether pre-fire agents of change such as bark beetle and timber harvest impact model accuracy. This study quantifies wildfire effects by correlating changes in forest structure derived from multi-temporal Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) acquisitions to multi-temporal spectral changes captured by the Landsat Thematic Mapper and Operational Land Imager for the 2012 Pole Creek Fire in central Oregon. Spatial regression modeling was assessed as a methodology to account for spatial autocorrelation, and model consistency was quantified across areas impacted by pre-fire mountain pine beetle and timber harvest. The strongest relationship (pseudo-r2 = 0.86, p &lt; 0.0001) was observed between the ratio of shortwave infrared and near infrared reflectance (d74) and LiDAR-derived estimate of canopy cover change. Relationships between percentage of LiDAR returns in forest strata and spectral indices generally increased in strength with strata height. Structural measurements made closer to the ground were not well correlated. The spatial regression approach improved all relationships, demonstrating its utility, but model performance declined across pre-fire agents of change, suggesting that such studies should stratify by pre-fire forest condition. This study establishes that spectral indices such as d74 and dNBR are most sensitive to wildfire-caused structural changes such as reduction in canopy cover and perform best when that structure has not been reduced pre-fire.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70191302</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keeley, Jon E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Why were California's wine country fires so destructive?</title><secondary-title>The Conversation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Conversation</full-title></periodical><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70192771</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Klinger, Rob</author><author>Brooks, Matt</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>D'Antonio, Carla</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Alternative pathways to landscape transformation: invasive grasses, burn severity and fire frequency in arid ecosystems</title><secondary-title>Journal of Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>1521-1533</pages><volume>105</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>disturbance</keyword><keyword>resilience</keyword><keyword>invasive species</keyword><keyword>chronosequence</keyword><keyword>biological invasions</keyword><keyword>community structure</keyword><keyword>deserts</keyword><keyword>fire regimes</keyword><keyword>resistance</keyword><keyword>secondary succession</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>November 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/1365-2745.12863</electronic-resource-num><abstract>* Arid ecosystems are often vulnerable to transformation to invasive-dominated states following fire, but data on persistence of these states are sparse. The grass/fire cycle is a feedback process between invasive annual grasses and fire frequency that often leads to the formation of alternative vegetation states dominated by the invasive grasses. However, other components of fire regimes, such as burn severity, also have the potential to produce long-term vegetation transformations. Our goal was to evaluate the influence of both fire frequency and burn severity on the transformation of woody-dominated communities to communities dominated by invasive grasses in major elevation zones of the Mojave Desert of western North America.   * We used a chronosequence design to collect data on herbaceous and woody cover at 229 unburned reference plots and 578 plots that burned between 1972 and 2010. We stratified the plots by elevation zone (low, mid, high), fire frequency (1–3 times) and years post-fire (YPF; 1–5, 6–10, 11–20 and 21–40 YPF). Burn severity for each plot was estimated by the difference normalized burn ratio.   * We identified two broad post-fire successional pathways. One was an outcome of fire frequency, resulting in a strong potential transformation via the grass/fire cycle. The second pathway was driven by burn severity, the critical aspect being that long-term transformation of a community could occur from just one fire in areas that burned at high or sometimes moderate severity. Dominance by invasive grasses was most likely to occur in low-and high-elevation communities; cover of native herbaceous species was often greater than that of invasive grasses in the mid-elevation zone.   * Synthesis. Invasive grasses can dominate a site that burned only one time in many decades at high severity, or a site that burned at low severity but multiple times in the same time period. However, high burn severity may predispose areas to more frequent fire because they have relatively high cover of invasive annual grass, suggesting burn severity and fire frequency have both independent and synergistic effects. Resilience in vegetation structure following fire in many arid communities may be limited to a narrow window of low burn severity in areas that have not burned in many decades.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70193277</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Parthum, Bryan</author><author>Pindilli, Emily</author><author>Hogan, Dianna</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Benefits of the fire mitigation ecosystem service in The Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, Virginia, USA</title><secondary-title>Journal of Environmental Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Environmental Management</full-title></periodical><pages>375-382</pages><volume>203</volume><issue>Part 1</issue><keywords><keyword>Ecosystem services</keyword><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Fire mitigation</keyword><keyword>Geospatial information</keyword><keyword>Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge</keyword><keyword>Human health</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>December 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.08.018</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Great Dismal Swamp (GDS) National Wildlife Refuge delivers multiple ecosystem services, including air quality and human health via fire mitigation. Our analysis estimates benefits of this service through its potential to reduce catastrophic wildfire related impacts on the health of nearby human populations. We used a combination of high-frequency satellite data, ground sensors, and air quality indices to determine periods of public exposure to dense emissions from a wildfire within the GDS. We examined emergency department (ED) visitation in seven Virginia counties during these periods, applied measures of cumulative Relative Risk to derive the effects of wildfire smoke exposure on ED visitation rates, and estimated economic losses using regional Cost of Illness values established within the US Environmental Protection Agency BenMAP framework. Our results estimated the value of one avoided catastrophic wildfire in the refuge to be $3.69 million (2015 USD), or $306 per hectare of burn. Reducing the frequency or severity of extensive, deep burning peatland wildfire events has additional benefits not included in this estimate, including avoided costs related to fire suppression during a burn, carbon dioxide emissions, impacts to wildlife, and negative outcomes associated with recreation and regional tourism. We suggest the societal value of the public health benefits alone provides a significant incentive for refuge mangers to implement strategies that will reduce the severity of catastrophic wildfires.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70193974</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Report">27</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moody, John A</author><author>Martin, Deborah</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Eighteen years (1996-2014) of channel cross-sectional measurements made in Spring Creek after the 1996 Buffalo Creek wildfire and subsequent flood</title></titles><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70181040</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wieting, Celeste</author><author>Ebel, Brian A.</author><author>Singha, Kamini</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantifying the effects of wildfire on changes in soil properties by surface burning of soils from the Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies</full-title></periodical><pages>43-57</pages><volume>13</volume><keywords><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Hydraulic conductivity</keyword><keyword>Infiltration</keyword><keyword>Boulder creek critical zone observatory</keyword><keyword>Bulk density</keyword><keyword>Soil core</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>October 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ejrh.2017.07.006</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Study region This study used intact soil cores collected at the Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory near Boulder, Colorado, USA to explore fire impacts on soil properties. Study focus Three soil scenarios were considered: unburned control soils, and low- and high-temperature burned soils. We explored simulated fire impacts on field-saturated hydraulic conductivity, dry bulk density, total organic carbon, and infiltration processes during rainfall simulations. New hydrological insights for the region Soils burned to high temperatures became more homogeneous with depth with respect to total organic carbon and bulk density, suggesting reductions in near-surface porosity. Organic matter decreased significantly with increasing soil temperature. Tension infiltration experiments suggested a decrease in infiltration rates from unburned to low-temperature burned soils, and an increase in infiltration rates in high-temperature burned soils. Non-parametric statistical tests showed that field-saturated hydraulic conductivity similarly decreased from unburned to low-temperature burned soils, and then increased with high-temperature burned soils. We interpret these changes result from the combustion of surface and near-surface organic materials, enabling water to infiltrate directly into soil instead of being stored in the litter and duff layer at the surface. Together, these results indicate that fire-induced changes in soil properties from low temperatures were not as drastic as high temperatures, but that reductions in surface soil water repellency in high temperatures may increase infiltration relative to low temperatures.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70192243</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pilliod, David S.</author><author>Welty, Justin L.</author><author>Arkle, Robert S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Refining the cheatgrass–fire cycle in the Great Basin: Precipitation timing and fine fuel composition predict wildfire trends</title><secondary-title>Ecology and Evolution</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecology and Evolution</full-title></periodical><pages>8126-8151</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>19</issue><keywords><keyword>Bromus tectorum</keyword><keyword>climate</keyword><keyword>annual forb</keyword><keyword>litter</keyword><keyword>sagebrush shrublands</keyword><keyword>weather</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>October 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/ece3.3414</electronic-resource-num><abstract>© 2017 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd. Larger, more frequent wildfires in arid and semi-arid ecosystems have been associated with invasion by non-native annual grasses, yet a complete understanding of fine fuel development and subsequent wildfire trends is lacking. We investigated the complex relationships among weather, fine fuels, and fire in the Great Basin, USA. We first modeled the annual and time-lagged effects of precipitation and temperature on herbaceous vegetation cover and litter accumulation over a 26-year period in the northern Great Basin. We then modeled how these fine fuels and weather patterns influence subsequent wildfires. We found that cheatgrass cover increased in years with higher precipitation and especially when one of the previous 3 years also was particularly wet. Cover of non-native forbs and native herbs also increased in wet years, but only after several dry years. The area burned by wildfire in a given year was mostly associated with native herb and non-native forb cover, whereas cheatgrass mainly influenced area burned in the form of litter derived from previous years’ growth. Consequently, multiyear weather patterns, including precipitation in the previous 1–3 years, was a strong predictor of wildfire in a given year because of the time needed to develop these fine fuel loads. The strong relationship between precipitation and wildfire allowed us to expand our inference to 10,162 wildfires across the entire Great Basin over a 35-year period from 1980 to 2014. Our results suggest that the region's precipitation pattern of consecutive wet years followed by consecutive dry years results in a cycle of fuel accumulation followed by weather conditions that increase the probability of wildfire events in the year when the cycle transitions from wet to dry. These patterns varied regionally but were strong enough to allow us to model annual wildfire risk across the Great Basin based on precipitation alone.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70191114</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stackpoole, Sarah M.</author><author>Butman, David E.</author><author>Clow, David W.</author><author>Verdin, Kristine L.</author><author>Gaglioti, Benjamin V.</author><author>Genet, Hélène</author><author>Striegl, Robert G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inland waters and their role in the carbon cycle of Alaska:</title><secondary-title>Ecological Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>1403-1420</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>permafrost</keyword><keyword>Arctic</keyword><keyword>boreal</keyword><keyword>Alaska carbon cycle</keyword><keyword>carbon balance</keyword><keyword>coastal rainforest</keyword><keyword>glacier</keyword><keyword>greenhouse gas emissions</keyword><keyword>inland waters</keyword><keyword>lateral export</keyword><keyword>methane</keyword><keyword>yedoma</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>July 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/eap.1552</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The magnitude of Alaska (AK) inland waters carbon (C) fluxes is likely to change in the future due to amplified climate warming impacts on the hydrology and biogeochemical processes in high latitude regions. Although current estimates of major aquatic C fluxes represent an essential baseline against which future change can be compared, a comprehensive assessment for AK has not yet been completed. To address this gap, we combined available data sets and applied consistent methodologies to estimate river lateral C export to the coast, river and lake carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions, and C burial in lakes for the six major hydrologic regions in the state. Estimated total aquatic C flux for AK was 41 Tg C/yr. Major components of this total flux, in Tg C/yr, were 18 for river lateral export, 17 for river CO2 emissions, and 8 for lake CO2 emissions. Lake C burial offset these fluxes by 2 Tg C/yr. River and lake CH4 emissions were 0.03 and 0.10 Tg C/yr, respectively. The Southeast and South central regions had the highest temperature, precipitation, terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP), and C yields (fluxes normalized to land area) were 77 and 42 g C·m−2·yr−1, respectively. Lake CO2 emissions represented over half of the total aquatic flux from the Southwest (37 g C·m−2·yr−1). The North Slope, Northwest, and Yukon regions had lesser yields (11, 15, and 17 g C·m2·yr−1), but these estimates may be the most vulnerable to future climate change, because of the heightened sensitivity of arctic and boreal ecosystems to intensified warming. Total aquatic C yield for AK was 27 g C·m−2·yr−1, which represented 16% of the estimated terrestrial NPP. Freshwater ecosystems represent a significant conduit for C loss, and a more comprehensive view of land-water-atmosphere interactions is necessary to predict future climate change impacts on the Alaskan ecosystem C balance.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70190128</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McAbee, Kathryn</author><author>Reinhardt, Keith</author><author>Germino, Matthew J.</author><author>Bosworth, Andrew</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Response of aboveground carbon balance to long-term, experimental enhancements in precipitation seasonality is contingent on plant community type in cold-desert rangelands</title><secondary-title>Oecologia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oecologia</full-title></periodical><pages>861-874</pages><volume>183</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Artemisia tridentata</keyword><keyword>Agropyron cristatum</keyword><keyword>Net ecosystem exchange</keyword><keyword>Photosynthesis</keyword><keyword>Respiration</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>March 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00442-017-3814-7</electronic-resource-num><abstract>? 2017 Springer-Verlag Berlin HeidelbergSemi-arid rangelands are important carbon (C) pools at global scales. However, the degree of net C storage or release in water-limited systems is a function of precipitation amount and timing, as well as plant community composition. In northern latitudes of western North America, C storage in cold-desert ecosystems could increase with boosts in wintertime precipitation, in which climate models predict, due to increases in wintertime soil water storage that enhance summertime productivity. However, there are few long-term, manipulative field-based studies investigating how rangelands will respond to altered precipitation amount or timing. We measured aboveground C pools and fluxes at leaf, soil, and ecosystem scales over a single growing season in plots that had 200 mm of supplemental precipitation added in either winter or summer for the past 21 years, in shrub- and exotic-bunchgrass-dominated garden plots. At our cold-desert site (298 mm precipitation during the study year), we hypothesized that increased winter precipitation would stimulate the aboveground C uptake and storage relative to ambient conditions, especially in plots containing shrubs. Our hypotheses were generally supported: ecosystem C uptake and long-term biomass accumulation were greater in winter- and summer-irrigated plots compared to control plots in both vegetation communities. However, substantial increases in the aboveground biomass occurred only in winter-irrigated plots that contained shrubs. Our findings suggest that increases in winter precipitation will enhance C storage of this widespread ecosystem, and moreso in shrub- compared to grass-dominated communities.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70179999</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Picotte, Joshua J</author><author>Long, Jordan</author><author>Peterson, Birgit</author><author>Nelson, Kurtis</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>LANDFIRE 2015 Remap – Utilization of Remotely Sensed Data to Classify Existing Vegetation Type and Structure to Support Strategic Planning and Tactical Response</title><secondary-title>Earthzine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Earthzine</full-title></periodical><volume>March 2017</volume><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70192856</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brenkert-Smith, Hannah</author><author>Meldrum, James R.</author><author>Champ, Patricia A.</author><author>Barth, Christopher M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Where you stand depends on where you sit: Qualitative inquiry into notions of fire adaptation</title><secondary-title>Ecology and Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecology and Society</full-title></periodical><pages>art7-art7</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Wildfire risk</keyword><keyword>Fire adaptation</keyword><keyword>Hazards and disasters</keyword><keyword>Social-ecological systems</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5751/ES-09471-220307</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70190018</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Butsic, Van</author><author>Syphard, Alexandra D.</author><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author><author>Bar-Massada, Avi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Can private land conservation reduce wildfire risk to homes?

However, private land conservation can also provide other benefits, one of these being natural hazard reduction. Here, we investigated the impacts of private land conservation on fire risk to homes in San Diego County, California. We coupled an econometric land use change model with a model that estimates the probability of house loss due to fire in order to compare fire risk at the county and municipality scale under alternative private land purchasing schemes and over a 20 year time horizon. We found that conservation purchases could reduce fire risk on this landscape, and the amount of risk reduction was related to the targeting approach used to choose which parcels were conserved. Conservation land purchases that targeted parcels designated as high fire hazard resulted in lower fire risk to homes than purchases that targeted low costs or high likelihood to subdivide. This result was driven by (1) preventing home placement in fire prone areas and (2) taking land off the market, and hence increasing development densities in other areas. These results raise the possibility that resource conservation and fire hazard reduction may benefit from combining efforts. With adequate planning, future conservation purchases could have synergistic effects beyond just protecting ecologically sensitive areas.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70178448</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brabec, Martha M.</author><author>Germino, Matthew J.</author><author>Richardson, Bryce A.</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Tulloch, Ayesha</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Climate adaption and post-fire restoration of a foundational perennial in cold desert: insights from intraspecific variation in response to weather</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>293-302</pages><volume>54</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>restoration</keyword><keyword>fire</keyword><keyword>Sagebrush</keyword><keyword>weather</keyword><keyword>climate response</keyword><keyword>freezing responses</keyword><keyword>seed zones</keyword><keyword>seedling survival</keyword><keyword>semi-arid landscapes</keyword><keyword>water stress</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>February 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/1365-2664.12679</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The loss of foundational but fire-intolerant perennials such as sagebrush due to increases in fire size and frequency in semi-arid regions has motivated efforts to restore them, often with mixed or even no success. Seeds of sagebrush Artemisia tridentata and related species must be moved considerable distances from seed source to planting sites, but such transfers have not been guided by an understanding of local climate adaptation. Initial seedling establishment and its response to weather are a key demographic bottleneck that likely varies among subspecies and populations of sagebrush. We assessed differences in survival, growth and physiological responses of sagebrush seedlings to weather among eleven seed sources that varied in subspecies, cytotype and climates-of-origin over 18 months following outplanting. Diploid or polyploid populations of mountain, Wyoming and basin big sagebrush (A. tridentata ssp. vaseyana, A. tridentata ssp. wyomingensis and A. tridentata ssp. tridentata, respectively) were planted onto five burned sites that normally support A.t. wyomingensis with some A.t. tridentata. A.t. wyomingensis had the most growth and survival, and tetraploid populations had greater survival and height than diploids. Seasonal timing of mortality varied among the subspecies/cytotypes and was more closely related to minimum temperatures than water deficit. Temperatures required to induce ice formation were up to 6 °C more negative in 4n-A.t. tridentata and A.t. wyomingensis than in other subspecies/cytotypes, indicating greater freezing avoidance. In contrast, freezing resistance of photosynthesis varied only 1 °C among subspecies/cytotypes, being greatest in A.t. wyomingensis and least in the subspecies normally considered most cold-adapted, A.t. vaseyana. A large spectrum of reliance on freezing avoidance vs. freezing tolerance was observed and corresponded to differences in post-fire survivorship among subspecies/cytotypes. Differences in water deficit responses among subspecies/cytotypes were not as strong and did not relate to survival patterns. Synthesis and applications. Low-temperature responses are a key axis defining climate adaptation in young sagebrush seedlings and vary more with cytotype than with subspecies, which contrasts with the traditional emphases on (i) water limitations to explain establishment in these deserts, and (ii) subspecies in selecting restoration seedings. These important and novel insights on climate adaptation are critical for seed selection and parameterizing seed transfer zones, and were made possible by incorporating weather data with survival statistics. The survival/weather statistics used here could be applied to any restoration planting or seeding to help elucidate factors contributing to success and enable adaptive management. © 2016 British Ecological Society.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70170894</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author><author>Syphard, Alexandra D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Different historical fire-climate patterns in California</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</full-title></periodical><pages>253-268</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>grasslands</keyword><keyword>climate change</keyword><keyword>chaparral</keyword><keyword>area burned</keyword><keyword>forests</keyword><keyword>ignitions</keyword><keyword>seasonal temperatures</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1071/WF16102</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The relationship between annual variation in area burned and seasonal temperatures and precipitation was investigated for the major climate divisions in California. Historical analyses showed marked differences in fires on montane and foothill landscapes. Based on roughly a century of data, there are five important lessons on fire–climate relationships in California: (1) seasonal variations in temperature appear to have had minimal influence on area burned in the lower elevation, mostly non-forested, landscapes; (2) temperature has been a significant factor in controlling fire activity in higher elevation montane forests, but this varied greatly with season – winter and autumn temperatures showed no significant effect, whereas spring and summer temperatures were important determinants of area burned; (3) current season precipitation has been a strong controller of fire activity in forests, with drier years resulting in greater area burned on most United States Forest Service (USFS) lands in the state, but the effect of current-year precipitation was decidedly less on lower elevation California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection lands; (4) in largely grass-dominated foothills and valleys the magnitude of prior-year rainfall was positively tied to area burned in the following year, and we hypothesise that this is tied to greater fuel volume in the year following high rainfall. In the southern part of the state this effect has become stronger in recent decades and this likely is due to accelerated type conversion from shrubland to grassland in the latter part of the 20th century; (5) the strongest fire–climate models were on USFS lands in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, and these explained 42–52% of the variation in area burned; however, the models changed over time, with winter and spring precipitation being the primary drivers in the first half of the 20th century, but replaced by spring and summer temperatures after 1960.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70189115</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lydersen, Jamie M.</author><author>Collins, Brandon M.</author><author>Brooks, Matthew L.</author><author>Matchett, John R.</author><author>Shive, Kristen L.</author><author>Povak, Nicholas A.</author><author>Kane, Van R.</author><author>Smith, Douglas F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evidence of fuels management and fire weather influencing fire severity in an extreme fire event:</title><secondary-title>Ecological Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>2013-2030</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Yosemite National Park</keyword><keyword>wildfire</keyword><keyword>fire severity</keyword><keyword>fire progression</keyword><keyword>fuels reduction</keyword><keyword>fuels treatment</keyword><keyword>landscape analysis</keyword><keyword>mixed conifer forest</keyword><keyword>Rim Fire</keyword><keyword>Stanislaus National Forest</keyword><keyword>thinning</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>October 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>4955139574</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/eap.1586</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Following changes in vegetation structure and pattern, along with a changing climate, large wildfire incidence has increased in forests throughout the western U.S. Given this increase there is great interest in whether fuels treatments and previous wildfire can alter fire severity patterns in large wildfires. We assessed the relative influence of previous fuels treatments (including wildfire), fire weather, vegetation and water balance on fire severity in the Rim Fire of 2013. We did this at three different spatial scales to investigate whether the influences on fire severity changed across scales. Both fuels treatments and previous low to moderate severity wildfire reduced the prevalence of high severity fire. In general, areas without recent fuels treatments and areas that previously burned at high severity tended to have a greater proportion of high severity fire in the Rim Fire. Areas treated with prescribed fire, especially when combined with thinning, had the lowest proportions of high severity. Proportion of the landscape burned at high severity was most strongly influenced by fire weather and proportional area previously treated for fuels or burned by low to moderate severity wildfire. The proportion treated needed to effectively reduce the amount of high fire severity fire varied by spatial scale of analysis, with smaller spatial scales requiring a greater proportion treated to see an effect on fire severity. When moderate and high severity fire encountered a previously treated area, fire severity was significantly reduced in the treated area relative to the adjacent untreated area. Our results show that fuels treatments and low to moderate severity wildfire can reduce fire severity in a subsequent wildfire, even when burning under fire growth conditions. These results serve as further evidence that both fuels treatments and lower severity wildfire can increase forest resilience. This article is protected by copyright.

Laboratory experiments suggest that fire-resistant building construction and design could be important for reducing structure destruction, but these need to be evaluated under real wildfire conditions, especially relative to other factors. Using empirical data from destroyed and surviving structures from large wildfires in southern California, we evaluated the relative importance of building construction and structure age compared to other local and landscape-scale variables associated with structure survival. The local-scale analysis showed that window preparation was especially important but, in general, creating defensible space adjacent to the home was as important as building construction. At the landscape scale, structure density and structure age were the two most important factors affecting structure survival, but there was a significant interaction between them. That is, young structure age was most important in higher-density areas where structure survival overall was more likely. On the other hand, newer-construction structures were less likely to survive wildfires at lower density. Here, appropriate defensible space near the structure and accessibility to major roads were important factors. In conclusion, community safety is a multivariate problem that will require a comprehensive solution involving land use planning, fire-safe construction, and property maintenance.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70182201</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sleeter, Rachel</author><author>Sleeter, Benjamin M.</author><author>Williams, Brianna</author><author>Hogan, Dianna</author><author>Hawbaker, Todd</author><author>Zhu, Zhiliang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A carbon balance model for the great dismal swamp ecosystem</title><secondary-title>Carbon Balance and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Carbon Balance and Management</full-title></periodical><pages>2-2</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Carbon sequestration</keyword><keyword>Great dismal swamp ecosystem</keyword><keyword>Lateral west fire</keyword><keyword>LUCAS model</keyword><keyword>Net ecosystem carbon balance</keyword><keyword>Peatland restoration</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>December 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1750-0680</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s13021-017-0070-4</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Carbon storage potential has become an important consideration for land management and planning in the United States. The ability to assess ecosystem carbon balance can help land managers understand the benefits and tradeoffs between different management strategies. This paper demonstrates an application of the Land Use and Carbon Scenario Simulator (LUCAS) model developed for local-scale land management at the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge. We estimate the net ecosystem carbon balance by considering past ecosystem disturbances resulting from storm damage, fire, and land management actions including hydrologic inundation, vegetation clear-ing, and replanting. Results: We modeled the annual ecosystem carbon stock and flow rates for the 30-year historic time period of 1985– 2015, using age-structured forest growth curves and known data for disturbance events and management activities. The 30-year total net ecosystem production was estimated to be a net sink of 0.97 Tg C. When a hurricane and six historic fire events were considered in the simulation, the Great Dismal Swamp became a net source of 0.89 Tg C. The cumulative above and below-ground carbon loss estimated from the South One and Lateral West fire events totaled 1.70 Tg C, while management activities removed an additional 0.01 Tg C. The carbon loss in below-ground biomass alone totaled 1.38 Tg C, with the balance (0.31 Tg C) coming from above-ground biomass and detritus. Conclusions: Natural disturbances substantially impact net ecosystem carbon balance in the Great Dismal Swamp. Through alternative management actions such as re-wetting, below-ground biomass loss may have been avoided, resulting in the added carbon storage capacity of 1.38 Tg. Based on two model assumptions used to simulate the peat system, (a burn scar totaling 70 cm in depth, and the soil carbon accumulation rate of 0.36 t C/ha −1 /year −1 for Atlantic white cedar), the total soil carbon loss from the South One and Lateral West fires would take approximately 1740 years to re-amass. Due to the impractical time horizon this presents for land managers, this particular loss is considered permanent. Going forward, the baseline carbon stock and flow parameters presented here will be used as reference conditions to model future scenarios of land management and disturbance.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70180205</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kane, Jeffrey M.</author><author>Van Mantgem, Phillip J.</author><author>Lalemand, Laura B.</author><author>Keifer, Marybeth</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Higher sensitivity and lower specificity in post-fire mortality model validation of 11 western US tree species</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Wildland Fire</full-title></periodical><pages>444-454</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>fire severity</keyword><keyword>fire effects modelling</keyword><keyword>fuel treatments</keyword><keyword>prescribed fire</keyword><keyword>trees</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1071/WF16081</electronic-resource-num><abstract>© IAWF 2017. Managers require accurate models to predict post-fire tree mortality to plan prescribed fire treatments and examine their effectiveness. Here we assess the performance of a common post-fire tree mortality model with an independent dataset of 11 tree species from 13 National Park Service units in the western USA. Overall model discrimination was generally strong, but performance varied considerably among species and sites. The model tended to have higher sensitivity (proportion of correctly classified dead trees) and lower specificity (proportion of correctly classified live trees) for many species, indicating an overestimation of mortality. Variation in model accuracy (percentage of live and dead trees correctly classified) among species was not related to sample size or percentage observed mortality. However, we observed a positive relationship between specificity and a species-specific bark thickness multiplier, indicating that overestimation was more common in thin-barked species. Accuracy was also quite low for thinner bark classes ( &lt; 1cm) for many species, leading to poorer model performance. Our results indicate that a common post-fire mortality model generally performs well across a range of species and sites; however, some thin-barked species and size classes would benefit from further refinement to improve model specificity.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70189650</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Syphard, Alexandra D.</author><author>Keeley, Jon E.</author><author>Abatzoglou, John T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Trends and drivers of fire activity vary across California aridland ecosystems</title><secondary-title>Journal of Arid Environments</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Arid Environments</full-title></periodical><pages>110-122</pages><volume>144</volume><keywords><keyword>Structural equation modeling</keyword><keyword>Land use</keyword><keyword>Ecoregion</keyword><keyword>Exotic grass</keyword><keyword>Grass-fire cycle</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>September 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jaridenv.2017.03.017</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fire activity has increased in western US aridland ecosystems due to increased human-caused ignitions and the expansion of flammable exotic grasses. Because many desert plants are not adapted to fire, increased fire activity may have long-lasting ecological impacts on native vegetation and the wildlife that depend on it. Given the heterogeneity across aridland ecosystems, it is important to understand how trends and drivers of fire vary, so management can be customized accordingly. We examined historical trends and quantified the relative importance of and interactions among multiple drivers of fire patterns across five aridland ecoregions in southeastern California from 1970 to 2010. Fire frequency increased across all ecoregions for the first couple decades, and declined or plateaued since the 1990s; but area burned continued to increase in some regions. The relative importance of anthropogenic and biophysical drivers varied across ecoregions, with both direct and indirect influences on fire. Anthropogenic variables were equally important as biophysical variables, but some contributed indirectly, presumably via their influence on annual grass distribution and abundance. Grass burned disproportionately more than other cover types, suggesting that addressing exotics may be the key to fire management and conservation in much of the area.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70189644</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Albano, Christine M.</author><author>Dettinger, Michael D.</author><author>Soulard, Christopher E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Influence of atmospheric rivers on vegetation productivity and fire patterns in the southwestern U.S.</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences</full-title></periodical><pages>308-323</pages><volume>122</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>fire</keyword><keyword>atmospheric rivers</keyword><keyword>vegetation productivity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2016JG003608</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70182525</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lovich, Jeffrey Edward</author><author>Quillman, Mari</author><author>Zitt, Brian</author><author>Schroeder, Adam</author><author>Green, David Earl</author><author>Yackulic, Charles</author><author>Gibbons, Paul</author><author>Goode, Eric</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The effects of drought and fire in the extirpation of an abundant semi-aquatic turtle from a lacustrine environment in the southwestern USA</title><secondary-title>Knowledge &amp; Management of Aquatic Ecosystems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Knowledge &amp; Management of Aquatic Ecosystems</full-title></periodical><pages>18-18</pages><volume>418</volume><issue>418</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>April 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1051/kmae/2017008</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.kmae-journal.org/10.1051/kmae/2017008</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sleeter, Rachel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Historic simulation of net ecosystem carbon balance for the Great Dismal Swamp</title></titles><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5066/F7KW5D6D</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70180212</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schultz, L.

Among the sites with pre-fire temperature data, we observed 2–4 °C increases in maximum daily stream temperature relative to an unburned control in the month following the fire; effects (elevated up to 6.6 °C) appeared to persist for at least one year. When observed August mean temperatures in 2015 (the peak of regionally severe drought) were compared to those predicted by a regional stream temperature model, we observed deviations of −2.1°-3.5°. The model under-predicted and over-predicted August mean by &gt; 1 °C in 54% and 10% of sites, respectively, and deviance from predicted was negatively associated with elevation.

After a fire, this zone is often found to be water repellent. This study aimed to understand the effects of post-fire water repellency on soil water and inorganic nitrogen and their effects on plant growth of the introduced annual Bromus tectorum and native bunchgrass Pseudoroegneria spicata. Plots centered on burned Juniperus osteosperma trees were either left untreated or treated with surfactant to ameliorate water repellency. After two years, we excavated soil from the untreated and treated plots and placed it in zero-tension lysimeter pots. In the greenhouse, half of the pots received an additional surfactant treatment. Pots were seeded separately with B. tectorum or P. spicata. Untreated soils had high runoff, decreased soil-water content, and elevated NO3–N in comparison to surfactant treated soils. The two plant species typically responded similar to the treatments. Above-ground biomass and microbial activity (estimated through soil CO2gas emissions) was 16.8-fold and 9.5-fold higher in the surfactant-treated soils than repellent soils, respectably. This study demonstrates that water repellency can influence site recovery by decreasing soil water content, promoting inorganic N retention, and impairing plant growth and microbial activity.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70187182</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Staley, Dennis M.</author><author>Negri, Jacquelyn A.</author><author>Kean, Jason W.</author><author>Laber, Jayme L.</author><author>Tillery, Anne C.</author><author>Youberg, Ann M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prediction of spatially explicit rainfall intensity–duration thresholds for post-fire debris-flow generation in the western United States</title><secondary-title>Geomorphology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geomorphology</full-title></periodical><pages>149-162</pages><volume>278</volume><keywords><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Debris flow</keyword><keyword>Hazard assessment</keyword><keyword>Rainfall thresholds</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>February 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.geomorph.2016.10.019</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Early warning of post-fire debris-flow occurrence during intense rainfall has traditionally relied upon a library of regionally specific empirical rainfall intensity–duration thresholds. Development of this library and the calculation of rainfall intensity-duration thresholds often require several years of monitoring local rainfall and hydrologic response to rainstorms, a time-consuming approach where results are often only applicable to the specific region where data were collected. Here, we present a new, fully predictive approach that utilizes rainfall, hydrologic response, and readily available geospatial data to predict rainfall intensity–duration thresholds for debris-flow generation in recently burned locations in the western United States. Unlike the traditional approach to defining regional thresholds from historical data, the proposed methodology permits the direct calculation of rainfall intensity–duration thresholds for areas where no such data exist. The thresholds calculated by this method are demonstrated to provide predictions that are of similar accuracy, and in some cases outperform, previously published regional intensity–duration thresholds. The method also provides improved predictions of debris-flow likelihood, which can be incorporated into existing approaches for post-fire debris-flow hazard assessment. Our results also provide guidance for the operational expansion of post-fire debris-flow early warning systems in areas where empirically defined regional rainfall intensity–duration thresholds do not currently exist.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70188478</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Murphy, Robert K.</author><author>Shaffer, Terry L.</author><author>Grant, Todd A.</author><author>Derrig, James L.</author><author>Rubin, Cory S.</author><author>Kerns, Courtney K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sparrow nest survival in relation to prescribed fire and woody plant invasion in a northern mixed-grass prairie</title><secondary-title>Wildlife Society Bulletin</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Wildlife Society Bulletin</full-title></periodical><pages>442-452</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>North Dakota</keyword><keyword>nest survival</keyword><keyword>prescribed fire</keyword><keyword>clay-colored sparrow</keyword><keyword>habitat management</keyword><keyword>northern mixed-grass prairie</keyword><keyword>Savannah sparrow</keyword><keyword>woody vegetation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>September 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/wsb.780</electronic-resource-num><abstract>© The Wildlife Society, 2017Prescribed fire is used to reverse invasion by woody vegetation on grasslands, but managers often are uncertain whether influences of shrub and tree reduction outweigh potential effects of fire on nest survival of grassland birds. During the 2001-2003 breeding seasons, we examined relationships of prescribed fire and woody vegetation to nest survival of clay-colored sparrow (Spizella pallida) and Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) in mixed-grass prairie at Des Lacs National Wildlife Refuge in northwestern North Dakota, USA. We assessed relationships of nest survival to 1) recent fire history, in terms of number of breeding seasons (2, 3, or 4-5) since the last prescribed fire, and 2) prevalence of trees and tall (&gt;1.5m) shrubs in the landscape and of low (≤1.5m) shrubs within 5m of nests. Nest survival of both species exhibited distinct patterns related to age of the nest and day of year, but bore no relationship to fire history. Survival of clay-colored sparrow nests declined as the amount of trees and tall shrubs within 100m increased, but we found no relationship to suggest nest parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) as an underlying mechanism. We found little evidence linking nest survival of Savannah sparrow to woody vegetation. Our results suggest that fire can be used to restore northern mixed-grass prairies without adversely affecting nest survival of ≥2 widespread passerine species. Survival of nests of clay-colored sparrow may increase when tall woody cover is reduced by fire. Our data lend support to the use of fire for reducing scattered patches of tall woody cover to enhance survival of nests of ≥1 grassland bird species in northern mixed-grass prairies, but further study is needed that incorporates experimental approaches and assessments of shorter term effects of fire on survival of nests of grassland passerines.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70189188</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pastick, Neal J.</author><author>Duffy, Paul</author><author>Genet, Hélène</author><author>Rupp, T.

Despite observations of the heightened sensitivity of these systems to change, there has not been a comprehensive assessment of fac-tors that drive ecosystem changes throughout Alaska. Here we present research that improves our understanding of the main drivers of the spatiotemporal patterns of carbon dynamics using in situ observations, remote sensing data, and an array of modeling tech-niques. In the last 60 yr, Alaska has seen a large increase in mean annual air temperature (1.7°C), with the greatest warming occurring over winter and spring. Warming trends are projected to continue throughout the 21st century and will likely result in landscape-level changes to ecosystem structure and function. Wetlands, mainly bogs and fens, which are cur-rently estimated to cover 12.5% of the landscape, strongly influence exchange of methane between Alaska's ecosystems and the atmosphere and are expected to be affected by thawing permafrost and shifts in hydrology. Simulations suggest the current proportion of near-sur-face (within 1 m) and deep (within 5 m) permafrost extent will be reduced by 9–74% and 33– 55% by the end of the 21st century, respectively. Since 2000, an average of 678 595 ha/yr was burned, more than twice the annual average during 1950–1999. The largest increase in fire activity is projected for the boreal forest, which could result in a reduction in late-succes-sional spruce forest (8–44%) and an increase in early-successional deciduous forest (25– 113%) that would mediate future fire activity and weaken permafrost stability in the region. Climate warming will also affect vegetation communities across arctic regions, where the cov-erage of deciduous forest could increase (223–620%), shrub tundra may increase (4–21%), and graminoid tundra might decrease (10–24%). This study sheds light on the sensitivity of Alaska's ecosystems to change that has the potential to significantly affect local and regional carbon balance, but more research is needed to improve estimates of land-surface and sub-surface properties, and to better account for ecosystem dynamics affected by a myriad of bio-physical factors and interactions.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70189822</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Campbell, John L.</author><author>Shinneman, Douglas J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Potential influence of wildfire in modulating climate-induced forest redistribution in a central Rocky Mountain landscape</title><secondary-title>Ecological Processes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Processes</full-title></periodical><pages>7-7</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>December 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s13717-017-0073-9</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ecologicalprocesses.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13717-017-0073-9</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McKenzie, Donald</author><author>Littell, Jeremy S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Climate change and the eco-hydrology of fire: Will area burned increase in a warming western USA</title><secondary-title>Ecological Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>26-36</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>climate change</keyword><keyword>ecosections</keyword><keyword>lagged response</keyword><keyword>negative feedback</keyword><keyword>nonstationarity</keyword><keyword>water-balance deficit</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>January 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>9788578110796</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/eap.1420</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70181760</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bottero, Alessandra</author><author>D'Amato, Anthony W.</author><author>Palik, Brian J.</author><author>Kern, Christel C.</author><author>Bradford, John B.</author><author>Scherer, Sawyer S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Influence of Repeated Prescribed Fire on Tree Growth and Mortality in Pinus resinosa Forests, Northern Minnesota</title><secondary-title>Forest Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forest Science</full-title></periodical><pages>94-100</pages><volume>63</volume><issue>1</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>February 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5849/forsci.16-035</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/10.5849/forsci.16-035</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Van Marle, Margreet J.E.</author><author>Kloster, Silvia</author><author>Magi, Brian I.</author><author>Marlon, Jennifer R.</author><author>Daniau, Anne Laure</author><author>Field, Robert D.</author><author>Arneth, Almut</author><author>Forrest, Matthew</author><author>Hantson, Stijn</author><author>Kehrwald, Natalie M.</author><author>Knorr, Wolfgang</author><author>Lasslop, Gitta</author><author>Li, Fang</author><author>Mangeon, Stéphane</author><author>Yue, Chao</author><author>Kaiser, Johannes W.</author><author>Van Der Werf, Guido R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Historic global biomass burning emissions for CMIP6 (BB4CMIP) based on merging satellite observations with proxies and fire models (1750-2015)</title><secondary-title>Geoscientific Model Development</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geoscientific Model Development</full-title></periodical><pages>3329-3357</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>9</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>September 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/gmd-10-3329-2017</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fires have influenced atmospheric composition and climate since the rise of vascular plants, and satellite data has shown the overall global extent of fires. Our knowledge of historic fire emissions has progressively improved over the past decades due mostly to the development of new proxies and the improvement of fire models. Currently there is a suite of proxies including sedimentary charcoal records, measurements of fire-emitted trace gases and black carbon stored in ice and firn, and visibility observations. These proxies provide opportunities to extrapolate emissions estimates based on satellite data starting in 1997 back in time, but each proxy has strengths and weaknesses regarding, for example, the spatial and temporal extents over which they are representative. We developed a new historic biomass burning emissions dataset starting in 1750 that merges the satellite record with several existing proxies, and uses the average of six models from the Fire Model Intercomparison Project (FireMIP) protocol to estimate emissions when the available proxies had limited coverage. According to our approach, global biomass burning emissions were relatively constant with 10-year averages varying between 1.8 and 2.3&amp;thinsp;Pg&amp;thinsp;C&amp;thinsp;year&amp;minus;1. Carbon emissions increased only slightly over the full time period and peaked during the 1990s after which they decreased gradually. There is substantial uncertainty in these estimates and patterns varied depending on choices regarding data representation, especially on regional scales. The observed pattern in fire carbon emissions is for a large part driven by African fires, which accounted for 58&amp;thinsp;% of global fire carbon emissions. African fire emissions declined since about 1950 due to conversion of savanna to cropland, and this decrease is partially compensated for by increasing emissions in deforestation zones of South America and Asia. These global fire emissions estimates are mostly suited for global analyses and will be used in the IPCC CMIP simulations.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/10/3329/2017/</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hawbaker, Todd J.</author><author>Vanderhoof, Melanie K.</author><author>Beal, Yen Ju</author><author>Takacs, Joshua D.</author><author>Schmidt, Gail L.</author><author>Falgout, Jeff T.</author><author>Williams, Brad</author><author>Fairaux, Nicole M.</author><author>Caldwell, Megan K.</author><author>Picotte, Joshua J.</author><author>Howard, Stephen M.</author><author>Stitt, Susan</author><author>Dwyer, John L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mapping burned areas using dense time-series of Landsat data</title><secondary-title>Remote Sensing of Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Remote Sensing of Environment</full-title></periodical><pages>504-522</pages><volume>198</volume><keywords><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Landsat</keyword><keyword>Burned area</keyword><keyword>Essential climate variable</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>September 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0034-4257</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.rse.2017.06.027</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Complete and accurate burned area data are needed to document patterns of fires, to quantify relationships between the patterns and drivers of fire occurrence, and to assess the impacts of fires on human and natural systems. Unfortunately, in many areas existing fire occurrence datasets are known to be incomplete. Consequently, the need to systematically collect burned area information has been recognized by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which have both called for the production of essential climate variables (ECVs), including information about burned area. In this paper, we present an algorithm that identifies burned areas in dense time-series of Landsat data to produce the Landsat Burned Area Essential Climate Variable (BAECV) products. The algorithm uses gradient boosted regression models to generate burn probability surfaces using band values and spectral indices from individual Landsat scenes, lagged reference conditions, and change metrics between the scene and reference predictors. Burn classifications are generated from the burn probability surfaces using pixel-level thresholding in combination with a region growing process. The algorithm can be applied anywhere Landsat and training data are available. For this study, BAECV products were generated for the conterminous United States from 1984 through 2015. These products consist of pixel-level burn probabilities for each Landsat scene, in addition to, annual composites including: the maximum burn probability and a burn classification. We compared the BAECV burn classification products to the existing Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED; 1997–2015) and Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS; 1984–2013) data. We found that the BAECV products mapped 36% more burned area than the GFED and 116% more burned area than MTBS. Differences between the BAECV products and the GFED were especially high in the West and East where the BAECV products mapped 32% and 88% more burned area, respectively. However, the BAECV products found less burned area than the GFED in regions with frequent agricultural fires. Compared to the MTBS data, the BAECV products identified 31% more burned area in the West, 312% more in the Great Plains, and 233% more in the East. Most pixels in the MTBS data were detected by the BAECV, regardless of burn severity. The BAECV products document patterns of fire similar to those in the GFED but also showed patterns of fire that are not well characterized by the existing MTBS data. We anticipate the BAECV products will be useful to studies that seek to understand past patterns of fire occurrence, the drivers that created them, and the impacts fires have on natural and human systems.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0034425717302857</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hawbaker, T.J.</author><author>Vanderhoof, M.K.</author><author>Beal, Y.G.</author><author>Takacs, J.D.</author><author>Schmidt, G.L.</author><author>Falgout, J.T.</author><author>Williams, Brad</author><author>Brunner, N.M.</author><author>Caldwell, M.K.</author><author>Picotte, J.J.</author><author>Howard, S.M.</author><author>Stitt, Susan</author><author>Dwyer, J.L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Landsat Burned Area Essential Climate Variable products for the conterminous United States (1984 -2015)</title><secondary-title>U.S. Geological Survey data release</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>U.S. Geological Survey data release</full-title></periodical><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5066/F73B5X76</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has developed and implemented an automated algorithm that identifies burned areas in temporally-dense time series of Landsat image stacks to produce the Landsat Burned Area Essential Climate Variable (BAECV) products.

Burned areas increase soil erosion rates within watersheds, which can increase sedimentation in downstream rivers and reservoirs. However, which watersheds will be impacted by future wildfires is largely unknown. Using an ensemble of climate, fire, and erosion models, we show that postfire sedimentation is projected to increase for nearly nine tenths of watersheds by &gt;10% and for more than one third of watersheds by &gt;100% by the 2041 to 2050 decade in the western USA. The projected increases are statistically significant for more than eight tenths of the watersheds. In the western USA, many human communities rely on water from rivers and reservoirs that originates in watersheds where sedimentation is projected to increase. Increased sedimentation could negatively impact water supply and quality for some communities, in addition to affecting stream channel stability and aquatic ecosystems.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/2017GL073979</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bright, Benjamin C.</author><author>Hudak, Andrew T.</author><author>Meddens, Arjan J.H.</author><author>Hawbaker, Todd J.</author><author>Briggs, Jennifer S.</author><author>Kennedy, Robert E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prediction of forest canopy and surface fuels from lidar and satellite time series data in a bark beetle-affected forest</title><secondary-title>Forests</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Forests</full-title></periodical><pages>322-322</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Canopy fuel</keyword><keyword>Landsat</keyword><keyword>Remote sensing</keyword><keyword>Lidar</keyword><keyword>Time series analysis</keyword><keyword>Bark beetle</keyword><keyword>Surface fuel</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>August 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/f8090322</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Wildfire behavior depends on the type, quantity, and condition of fuels, and the effect that bark beetle outbreaks have on fuels is a topic of current research and debate. Remote sensing can provide estimates of fuels across landscapes, although few studies have estimated surface fuels from remote sensing data. Here we predicted and mapped field-measured canopy and surface fuels from light detection and ranging (lidar) and Landsat time series explanatory variables via random forest (RF) modeling across a coniferous montane forest in Colorado, USA, which was affected by mountain pine beetles (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) approximately six years prior. We examined relationships between mapped fuels and the severity of tree mortality with correlation tests. RF models explained 59%, 48%, 35%, and 70% of the variation in available canopy fuel, canopy bulk density, canopy base height, and canopy height, respectively (percent root-mean-square error (%RMSE) = 12–54%). Surface fuels were predicted less accurately, with models explaining 24%, 28%, 32%, and 30% of the variation in litter and duff, 1 to 100-h, 1000-h, and total surface fuels, respectively (%RMSE = 37–98%). Fuel metrics were negatively correlated with the severity of tree mortality, except canopy base height, which increased with greater tree mortality. Our results showed how bark beetle-caused tree mortality significantly reduced canopy fuels in our study area. We demonstrated that lidar and Landsat time series data contain substantial information about canopy and surface fuels and can be used for large-scale efforts to monitor and map fuel loads for fire behavior modeling at a landscape scale.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/8/9/322</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vanderhoof, K.M.</author><author>Brunner, N.</author><author>Beal, G.Y.-J.</author><author>Hawbaker, J.T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of the U.S. Geological Survey Landsat Burned Area Essential Climate Variable across the Conterminous U.S. Using Commercial High-Resolution Imagery</title><secondary-title>Remote Sensing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Remote Sensing</full-title></periodical><pages>743-743</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>7</issue><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>July 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1303236141</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/rs9070743</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The U.S. Geological Survey has produced the Landsat Burned Area Essential Climate Variable (BAECV) product for the conterminous United States (CONUS), which provides wall-to-wall annual maps of burned area at 30 m resolution (1984-2015). Validation is a critical component in the generation of such remotely sensed products. Previous efforts to validate the BAECV relied on a reference dataset derived from Landsat, which was effective in evaluating the product across its timespan but did not allow for consideration of inaccuracies imposed by the Landsat sensor itself. In this effort, the BAECV was validated using 286 high-resolution images, collected from GeoEye-1, QuickBird-2, Worldview-2 and RapidEye satellites. A disproportionate sampling strategy was utilized to ensure enough burned area pixels were collected. Errors of omission and commission for burned area averaged 22 +/- 4% and 48 +/- 3%, respectively, across CONUS. Errors were lowest across the western U.S. The elevated error of commission relative to omission was largely driven by patterns in the Great Plains which saw low errors of omission (13 +/- 13%) but high errors of commission (70 +/- 5%) and potentially a region-growing function included in the BAECV algorithm. While the BAECV reliably detected agricultural fires in the Great Plains, it frequently mapped tilled areas or areas with low vegetation as burned. Landscape metrics were calculated for individual fire events to assess the influence of image resolution (2 m, 30 m and 500 m) on mapping fire heterogeneity. As the spatial detail of imagery increased, fire events were mapped in a patchier manner with greater patch and edge densities, and shape complexity, which can influence estimates of total greenhouse gas emissions and rates of vegetation recovery. The increasing number of satellites collecting high-resolution imagery and rapid improvements in the frequency with which imagery is being collected means greater opportunities to utilize these sources of imagery for Landsat product validation.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/9/7/743</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Guiterman, Christopher H.</author><author>Margolis, Ellis Q.</author><author>Allen, Craig D.</author><author>Falk, Donald A.</author><author>Swetnam, Thomas W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Long-Term Persistence and Fire Resilience of Oak Shrubfields in Dry Conifer Forests of Northern New Mexico</title><secondary-title>Ecosystems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecosystems</full-title></periodical><pages>1-17</pages><keywords><keyword>tree rings</keyword><keyword>alternative stable states</keyword><keyword>dry conifer ecosystems</keyword><keyword>fire-origin shrubfields</keyword><keyword>gambel oak</keyword><keyword>high-severity fire</keyword><keyword>metastability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>October 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1002101701922</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10021-017-0192-2</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Extensive high-severity fires are creating large shrubfields in many dry conifer forests of the interior western USA, raising concerns about forest-to-shrub conversion. This study evaluates the role of disturbance in shrubfield formation, maintenance and succession in the Jemez Mountains, New Mexico. We compared the environmental conditions of extant Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) shrubfields with adjoining dry conifer forests and used dendroecological methods to determine the multi-century fire history and successional dynamics of five of the largest shrubfields (76--340 ha). Across the study area, 349 shrubfields (5--368 ha) occur in similar topographic and climate settings as dry conifer forests. This suggests disturbance, rather than other biophysical factors, may explain their origins and persistence. Gambel oak ages and tree-ring fire scars in our sampled shrubfields indicate they historically (1664--1899) burned concurrently with adjoining conifer forests and have persisted for over 115 years in the absence of fire. Aerial imagery from 1935 confirmed almost no change in sampled shrubfield patch sizes or boundaries over the twentieth century. The largest shrubfield we identified is less than 4% the size of the largest conifer-depleted and substantially shrub-dominated area recently formed in the Jemez following extensive high-severity wildfires, indicating considerable departure from historical patterns and processes. Projected hotter droughts and increasingly large high-severity fires could trigger more forest-to-shrub transitions and maintain existing shrubfields, inhibiting conifer forest recovery. Restoration of surface fire regimes and associated historical forest structures likely could reduce the rate and patch size of dry conifer forests being converted to shrubfields.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1007/s10021-017-0192-2</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vanderhoof, Melanie K.</author><author>Fairaux, Nicole</author><author>Beal, Yen Ju G.</author><author>Hawbaker, Todd J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Validation of the USGS Landsat Burned Area Essential Climate Variable (BAECV) across the conterminous United States</title><secondary-title>Remote Sensing of Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Remote Sensing of Environment</full-title></periodical><pages>393-406</pages><volume>198</volume><keywords><keyword>Fire</keyword><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>Landsat</keyword><keyword>Burned area</keyword><keyword>Essential climate variable</keyword><keyword>Validation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.rse.2017.06.025</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Landsat Burned Area Essential Climate Variable (BAECV), developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), capitalizes on the long temporal availability of Landsat imagery to identify burned areas across the conterminous United States (CONUS) (1984–2015). Adequate validation of such products is critical for their proper usage and interpretation. Validation of coarse-resolution products often relies on independent data derived from moderate-resolution sensors (e.g., Landsat). Validation of Landsat products, in turn, is challenging because there is no corresponding source of high-resolution, multispectral imagery that has been systematically collected in space and time over the entire temporal extent of the Landsat archive. Because of this, comparison between high-resolution images and Landsat science products can help increase user's confidence in the Landsat science products, but may not, alone, be adequate. In this paper, we demonstrate an approach to systematically validate the Landsat-derived BAECV product. Burned area extent was mapped for Landsat image pairs using a manually trained semi-automated algorithm that was manually edited across 28 path/rows and five different years (1988, 1993, 1998, 2003, 2008). Three datasets were independently developed by three analysts and the datasets were integrated on a pixel by pixel basis in which at least one to all three analysts were required to agree a pixel was burned. We found that errors within our Landsat reference dataset could be minimized by using the rendition of the dataset in which pixels were mapped as burned if at least two of the three analysts agreed. BAECV errors of omission and commission for the detection of burned pixels averaged 42% and 33%, respectively for CONUS across all five validation years. Errors of omission and commission were lowest across the western CONUS, for example in the shrub and scrublands of the Arid West (31% and 24%, respectively), and highest in the grasslands and agricultural lands of the Great Plains in central CONUS (62% and 57%, respectively). The BAECV product detected most (&gt; 65%) fire events &gt; 10 ha across the western CONUS (Arid and Mountain West ecoregions). Our approach and results demonstrate that a thorough validation of Landsat science products can be completed with independent Landsat-derived reference data, but could be strengthened by the use of complementary sources of high-resolution data.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>10.5066/F7T151VX</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Margolis, E.

Climate is a primary driver of wildfire, and understanding fire-climate relationships is crucial for informing fire management and modeling the effects of climate change on fire. In the southwestern USA, fire-climate relationships have been informed by tree-ring data that extend centuries prior to the onset of fire exclusion in the late 1800s. Variability in cool-season precipitation has been linked to fire occurrence, but the effects of the summer North American monsoon on fire are less understood, as are the effects of climate on fire seasonality. We use a new set of reconstructions for cool-season (October–April) and monsoon-season (July– August) moisture conditions along with a large new fire scar dataset to examine relationships between multi-seasonal climate variability, fire extent, and fire seasonality in the Jemez Mountains, New Mexico (1599–1899 CE). Results suggest that large fires burning in all seasons are strongly influenced by the current year cool-season moisture, but fires burning mid-summer to fall are also influenced by monsoon moisture. Wet conditions several years prior to the fire year during the cool season, and to a lesser extent during the monsoon season, are also important for spring through late-summer fires. Persistent cool-season drought longer than 3 years may inhibit fires due to the lack of moisture to replenish surface fuels. This suggests that fuels may become increasingly limiting for fire occurrence in semi-arid regions that are projected to become drier with climate change.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-017-1958-4</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huang, Chao</author><author>He, Hong S.</author><author>Hawbaker, Todd J.</author><author>Liang, Yu</author><author>Gong, Peng</author><author>Wu, Zhiwei</author><author>Zhu, Zhiliang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A coupled modeling framework for predicting ecosystem carbon dynamics in boreal forests</title><secondary-title>Environmental Modelling &amp; Software</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Modelling &amp; Software</full-title></periodical><pages>332-343</pages><volume>93</volume><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>July 2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.envsoft.2017.03.009</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Carbon stocks in boreal forests play an important role in global carbon balance but are sensitive to climate change and disturbances. Ecological models offer valuable insights into the effects of climate change and disturbances on boreal forests carbon stocks. However, the current pixel-based model coupling approaches are challenging to apply over large spatial extents because high computational loads and model parameterizations. Therefore, we developed a new framework for coupling a forest ecosystem and a landscape model to predict aboveground and soil organic carbon stocks at the ecoregion level. Our results indicated that the new model-coupling framework has some advantages on computation efficiency and model validation. The model results showed that carbon stocks and its spatial distribution were significantly influenced by fire, harvest, and their interactions. Simulation results showed that boreal forests carbon stocks are vulnerable to loss because of future potential disturbances, complicating efforts to offset greenhouse gas emissions through forest management.
